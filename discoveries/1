    ## Going through changes
    Stationarity is gone ? (starting here) for global hydrological water cycle under the warming climate and human disturbances. This imposes challenges in systems for hydrological forecasting and water management as those were designed and operated under the assumption of stationarity.

    Identifying the nature of non-stationarity of global water cycle is essential to understand the global distribution of water availability, changes in extremes, and to provide support on optimizing water systems.

    ## Seasonal Changes in TWS
    We provide a global assessment of the non-stationarity patterns in hydrological variables, including terrestrial water storage, evapotranspiration, and runoff.

    ## Where are the hotspots of nonstationarity?
    Evidence indicates a wide extent of seasonality shifts, long-term trends, variability intensifications and frequency changes in these fluxes. Our findings identify the hot spot regions that are experiencing strong non-stationary changes and discuss the associated attribution factors.

    We highlight the impact of human water use on water cycle non-stationarity and the need to incorporate satellite observation constraints in assessing the shifts in global water storage variabilities.

    ## Modeling TWS
    TWS is modeled using Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) within LIS framework by assimilating NASA earth observations of soil moisture from ESA CCI, leaf area index from MODIS sensor, and TWS from GRACE/GRACE-FO. The modeled TWS is produced over global domain at a resolution of 10 km.

  <Prose>
    ## Interpreting the data
    The TWS anomalies are calculated as differences of raw TWS with the climatology obtained over 2001-2021. Negative anomalies denote lower than normal TWS and vice-versa. The trend over time is thus deseasonalized and reflective of changes due to human impacts.

    ## Declining trends, depleting storage!  
    Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is defined as the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface. It includes surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, groundwater, snow, ice, water stored in the vegetation, river and lake water.
