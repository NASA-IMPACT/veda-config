    ## The Value of Data
    
    Providing insights into agricultural production, crop conditions, and food supply are among some of the most impactful information provided by Earth observing satellites. Information derived from the data retrieved can affect the price we pay at grocery stores, effect policy implementation from regional to global scales, and food security around the world. Not only can satellite data tell us about current and near-future food and commodity crop conditions, but researchers are also studying the long-term trends in climate change and its effects on our food supply in support of agricultural resilience.

    As demonstrated by recent global crises including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine, the globally interconnected nature of the agri-food system has been thrust into the spotlight. These extreme disruptions to the global food supply underscore the importance of global agriculture monitoring, both of major producing countries and those who are major importers and therefore most vulnerable to food insecurity. A key example of international coordination in support of better food information is the G20 GEOGLAM Crop Monitor spearheaded by NASA scientists in response to a request from the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS). The Crop Monitor provides a public good of open, timely, science-driven information on crop conditions in support of market transparency. The GEOGLAM Crop Monitor Initiative is supported by the [global agriculture community](https://cropmonitor.org/index.php/about/amis-partners-cm/) and national space agencies - including the NASA Harvest Consortium and US-based institutions, The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, (JAXA) deleteand JASMINdelete, the European Space Agency (ESA) and several European institutions, ministries of agriculture across the globe and many more. It reflects an international, multi-source, consensus assessment of crop growing conditions, status, and agro-climatic (the relationship between crops and the climate) factors likely to impact global production. The focus areas are the major producing and trading countries for the four primary crops monitored by AMIS (wheat, maize, rice, and soybean),  as well as the countries most at risk to food insecurity and their primary staple crops.

  ## Why We Monitor Agricultural Production

Any extreme event such as conflict, severe weather, or environmental abnormalities pose threats to agricultural production and may shock the system which is why it is so critical to have the accessible, transparent, timely, and global information afforded by satellite data. For example, based on community consensus and available satellite data we understand that at the end of June 2022, conditions are generally favorable for maize, rice and soybean production, while mixed for wheat. We also know that in the northern hemisphere, there are areas of concern for wheat in North America, Europe, and Central Asia. In the southern hemisphere, sowing in Argentina has begun under mixed conditions. While maize harvest continues in the southern hemisphere, crop growth continues in the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, rice conditions are generally favorable except southern China and Indonesia. Satellite data helps us monitor these global crop conditions on a regular basis, especially in times and places where ground access is dangerous or limited.

    ## What We Monitor

    With the help of satellites, we are able to monitor crops throughout the growing seasons and can use a combination of satellite derived time series to quantify critical indicators related to crop health for a specific region and crop over time. One such example of satellite-derived products is the GEOGLAM-NASA Harvest Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observation Indicators, which are supported by the global remote sensing community and updated every 7-12 days to ensure users have the most up- to- date information. Displaying climate, environmental, and vegetative variables that impact agricultural outcomes, the AGMET Indicators were born from an agricultural stakeholder-identified need for a simple way to visualize and frequently monitor crop health with the ultimate goal of identifying potential cropping concerns as the growing season progresses, and before a food shortage materializes. Satellite data provides a wealth of information to meet these needs including:

    **1. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A measure of crop health.**

    This is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation. As a crop season progresses, NDVI values will increase during early crop growth and development of leafy vegetation, and will reach the peak as the crop fully develops and reaches maturity (before senescence -or deterioration), and then will decrease again as the crop matures and as the leafy vegetation begins to die off. How the NDVI values progress over the course of the season and the individual peak values, can help predict the productivity of the crops and be compared to previous seasons.

    **2. Surface soil moisture: A measure of water stored in the ground and available to crops.**

    Like NDVI, surface soil moisture is a key component for crop production that can be measured using satellite data (such as NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) instrument). The amount of moisture in the soil will depend on meteorological conditions that can be measured with the help of satellite data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) as well as sun exposure, wind, runoff/drainage, and soil type. If there is less water in the soil, it will be more difficult for crop roots to take up that water, resulting in a crop that is under greater stress. If the stress continues, the crop will wilt and eventually die. However, if the soil is above field capacity and the pores are oversaturated with water, then oxygen levels are restricted, and it can be detrimental for the crop. This is why soil moisture is a key indicator of what may ultimately be a successful or failed crop.

    ## Examples

    The Southern Plains are a major wheat producing region in the U.S. and are monitored closely from planting to harvest given the importance of this major commodity crop. The AGMET Indicator graphic for the 2022 Southern Plains winter wheat season (below) shows below-average cumulative precipitation, NDVI, and soil moisture, consistent with drought conditions trending throughout the Southern Plains. U.S. winter wheat is typically harvested over the summer months but due to the drought conditions affecting the region, there is concern over the potential yields. With the help of satellite data, we understand several months ahead of the harvest that we might expect lower than average production as a result of the environmental indicators measured. With this knowledge comes the ability to respond and prepare appropriately while simultaneously providing market transparency.

    Not only does satellite data help us understand the current season's productivity, but they also provide a rich historical record of agricultural measurements that enable researchers to compare outcomes to previous seasons and evaluate broader trends such as the impacts of climate change.

    Significant parts of Northern Africa and the Middle East are experiencing drought conditions including countries such as Morocco, Tunisia (see below), Syria and Iraq that are significantly impacting crop production. Earth observations are key to identifying and quantifying these impacts early and in providing support for future agricultural planning and mitigation actions when needed.

    Likewise in Southern Brazil crops did not receive the expected amount of precipitation, which negatively impacted yields of the spring planted crop. Looking at the information provided by satellite data, the drought conditions are striking and serve as a preemptive sign that governments and markets should prepare for less commodity crops coming out of this region of Brazil. This not only impacts Brazil and the global market, but also the countries that rely on the region for their food/feed imports. Earth observations can give an early indication of threats to food security should supplies end up being less than needed. Another benefit of remotely sensed satellite data is these types of evaluations can be done anywhere in the world throughout the season.

    As data access and technology have made significant advances in recent decades, it comes as no surprise that the amount of available data can often be overwhelming and difficult to decipher. Tools such as the [GEOGLAM-Harvest AGMET Indicators](https://cropmonitor.org/tools/agmet/) play a key role for quick and digestible information processing and supporting key agricultural decisions. To increase food market stability and reduce price volatility, it is critical that market analysts, farmers, and other agricultural stakeholders have a thorough understanding of the amount of food coming to market - whether that be in line with the average amount seen in previous years or more/less. Just as with any other consumer good, supply and demand are the key drivers of agri-food (relating to the commercial production of food by farming) markets and commodity prices. Satellite data can fill a critical gap in agricultural monitoring, enabling us to not only understand current crop conditions but prepare for potential outcomes in a given growing season. The benefits include wider-reaching impacts on market stability, earlier reaction time for humanitarian response, and bolstering food security.
