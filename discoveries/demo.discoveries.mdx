    ## VEDA is a dashboard to explore data

    VEDA is organized around the concept of Thematic areas. Each thematic area explores a topic in detail via datasets and discoveries.
    A Dataset represents a piece of geo-referenced data displayed as a set of related layers on a map.
    Discoveries are long form pieces of content that tell a story about some interesting portion of the data.
