  ## Introduction
    Fires are an integral part of the Earth system and have a large human dimension. Society's interaction with the Earth system affects fire risk, fire spread, and fire impacts (e.g. property destruction, emissions, mud slides). NASA data products and models provide real-time information on active fires, smoke, air quality, and forecasts of changing fire weather and seasonal fire risk.

     
    EIS provides a platform for collaborative analysis of and decision support for pre-fire risk, active fire situational awareness, and managing post-fire impacts. The full potential of these individual efforts are realized through the EIS collaborative framework to support new transdisciplinary connections and fire-related management activities.

    ## Fires in Western U.S.

    Catastrophic wildfires are on increase across the Western United States. While fires constitute an important rangeland disturbance process in the semi-arid ecosystems of the Western U.S., climate change and intensifying droughts have increased the frequency and vigor of wildfires.

    This chart shows total area burned from 1984 to 2020 in the Western U.S.

      NASAâ€™s Earth Information System (EIS) analysis captures the onset of drought and heightened fire conditions in mid-August 2021, with seasonal deficits of rainfall, exceptionally dry soils, onset of acute vegetation stress, and reduced plant growth

    ## Drought Conditions Set the Stage for an Intense Fire Season in California in 2021

	The 2021 wildfire season in California started amid an ongoing drought and historically low rainfall and reservoir levels. By August, seasonal deficits of rainfall result in anomalously dry soils in large parts of the Western U.S. Eventually, the vegetation dried out as the roots couldn't provide moisture to meet atmospheric demand. This vegetation stress is captured as reduced plant growth by thermal imaging satellites and the Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) using the Goddard [Land Information System (LIS)](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) framework.

    ## Developments in Fire Risk Modeling

	Dry, windy weather combines with the dry vegetation to create perfect conditions for WildFires across much of Northern California in the summer of 2021. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a globally used tool to track the developing risk of fire. The FWI tracks closely with the Burning Index of the US-focused National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS). Traditionally based only on weather data, these fire risk indices have limited spatial detail. 

EIS can connect more detailed land surface information with existing weather-based fire-risk indices. This comparison shows the potential for a land surface model informed index compared to a pure weather-based index.

    ## Vegetation Responds with Reduced Transpiration

    Fire leads to an immediate and lasting reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) over burned areas. This can be tracked for post-fire years using the [OpenET archive](https://openetdata.org/). OpenET produces ET estimates based on high-resolution Landsat observations and several different models. 
    
    By  comparing the annual ET of the post-fire year with the pre-fire 5-year mean value, we get a map that compares well with the burn severity maps from MTBS.

    ## Impacts on Hydrology - A Journey Across Fires
     
    Response of vegetation to fire disturbances is a complex interplay of climate conditions, landcover, and burn severity. [OpenET](https://openetdata.org/) observations of ET ([DisALEXI model](https://openetdata.org/methodologies/)) capture the decline in ET after the fire. The progression of spatially-averaged ET over the burned and control regions (unimpacted from fire) show the post-fire recovery of vegetation. 
    
    Below are three recent fire events showing these ET recovery trends.

    ## 2017 Preacher Fire in Nevada
    Ignited on July 24, 2017, the Preacher fire burned ~5000 ac of grassland with moderate severity. OpenET data show vegetation responded with declining ET, but transpiration recovered within a couple of post-fire seasons.

    ## 2018 Natchez Fire in Northern California
    The Natchez fire started on July 15, 2018 and burned a massive 38,800 ac of forested landscape with high severity. Post-fire ET data show that vegetation sustained the impact on ET for a longer period of time, with incomplete recovery even after three post-fire seasons.

    ## 2017 Thomas Fire in Southern California
    
    On Dec 4, 2017, the Thomas fire burned 281,982 acres surpassing all preceding wildfires in modern California history, causing over $2.2 billion USD in damages. A mix of savannas and grasslands sustained moderate severity burns. Recovery was still incomplete by the end of 2021 (based on most recently available OpenET data).
