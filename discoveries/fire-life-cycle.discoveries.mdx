  ## Introduction
    Fires are an integral part of the Earth system and have a large human dimension. Society's interaction with the Earth system affects fire risk, fire spread, and fire impacts (e.g. property destruction, emissions, mud slides). NASA data products and models provide real-time information on active fires, smoke, air quality, and forecasts of changing fire weather and seasonal fire risk.

     
    EIS provides a platform for collaborative analysis of and decision support for pre-fire risk, active fire situational awareness, and managing post-fire impacts. The full potential of these individual efforts are realized through the EIS collaborative framework to support new transdisciplinary connections and fire-related management activities.

    ## Fires in Western US

    The Western United States is experiencing an increase of catastrophic wildfires. While fires historically constituted an important rangeland disturbance process in the semi-arid ecosystems of the Western US, climate change and intensifying droughts have increased the frequency and vigor of wildfire occurrences.

    This chart shows total area burnt from 1984 to 2020 in Western US.

    ## Drought conditions set the stage for an intense fire season in California in 2021

	The 2021 wildfire season in California started amid an ongoing drought and historically low rainfall and reservoir levels. By August, seasonal deficits of rainfall result in anomalously dry soils in large parts of the Western US. Eventually, the vegetation dries out as the roots canâ€™t provide moisture to meet atmospheric demand. This vegetation stress is captured by thermal imaging satellites and by the model as reduced plant growth.

    ## New developments in fire risk modeling

	Dry, windy weather combines with the dry vegetation to create perfect conditions for WildFires across much of Northern California in the summer of 2021. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a globally used tool to track the developing risk of fire. The FWI tracks closely with the Burning Index of the US-focused National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS). Traditionally based only on weather data, these fire risk indices have limited spatial detail. 

EIS can connect more detailed land surface information with existing weather-based fire-risk indices. This comparison shows the potential for a land surface model informed index compared to a pure weather-based index.

	Real-time global fire event monitoring: Tracking every fire on Earth, every 12 hours, using an automated algorithm that converts satellite measurements of fire occurrence and energy output on a pixel-by-pixel basis to maps of the active fire perimeter and cumulative burned area (dataset #6)

	Improve representation of fires and fire emissions in atmospheric models: Update model information related to emissions from different land cover types, improve the representation of the diurnal cycle of fires, and evaluate new model predictions against satellite, airborne, and ground-based measurements of atmospheric composition and air quality (dataset #7)

	GHG emissions (dataset #8)

    ## Vegetation Responds with Reduced Transpiration

    Fire leads to an immediate and lasting reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) over burned areas. This can be tracked over the post-fire years using the OpenET archive. OpenET produces ET estimates based on high-resolution Landsat observations and according to several different modeling approaches. 
    
    By  comparing the annual ET of the post-fire year with the pre-fire 5-year mean value, we get a map that compares strikingly well with the burn area and severity maps (MTBS: Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity).

    High resolution observations of ET from OpenET product captures the impact of fires on ET. Large declines in post-fire ET are observed that correspond to burn scars from high severity fires during the fire year 2020.

    ## Impacts on Hydrology - A Journey Across Fires
     
    Response of vegetation to fire disturbances is a complex interplay of climate conditions, landcover, and burn severity. To explore such inter-relationships, we present here a few fire events and the progression of ET before and beyond the burn.
    
    [OpenET](https://openetdata.org/) observations of ET ([DisALEXI model](https://openetdata.org/methodologies/)) capture the changes in ET after the fire events. Progression of spatially-averaged ET over the burned and control regions (unimpacted from fire) in the charts show the post-fire recovery of transpiration.

    ## 2017 Preacher fire in NV
    Ignited on July 24, 2017, Preacher fire burnt ~5000 ac of grassland in Nevada with moderate severity. Vegetation responded with declining ET but the transpiration recovery happened rapidly within a couple of post-fire seasons.

    Natchez fire started on July 15, 2018 to burn a massive 38,800 ac of forested landscape in Northern CA with high severity. Vegetation sustained the impact on reduced post-fire ET for a longer period of time, showing incomplete recovery even after three post-fire seasons.

    Thoms fire, that started on Dec 4, 2017, burned 281,982 acres surpassing all the preceding wildfires in modern California history and caused over $2.2 billion USD in damages. A mix of savannas and grasslands were affected with moderate severity burns, resulting in an incomplete recovery by the end of 2021.

    ## The response of ecosystem to fires is complex!
    
    Post-fire management and risk assessment thus need to include the control of landcover, fire properties,  and climate disturbances in studying the hydrology of burnt and surrounding regions.
