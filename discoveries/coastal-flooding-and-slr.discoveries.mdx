  ## Introduction
  
  ***[Add an overview paragraphâ€¦]***
  
  EIS provides a platform for collaborative analysis and decision support for adapting to sea level changes, human-caused water cycle intensification, and their impacts. The full potential of these individual efforts are realized through the EIS collaborative framework to support new transdisciplinary connections.
