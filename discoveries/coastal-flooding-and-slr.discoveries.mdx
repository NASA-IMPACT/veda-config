  The Earth Information System (EIS) provides a platform for collaborative analysis and decision support for adapting to sea-level changes, human-caused water cycle change, and their impacts. The full potential of these individual efforts are realized through the EIS project, which supports Earth system science through transdisciplinary connections between researchers across traditional science disciplines, applied sciences, and data systems.

  ## Evidence of Global Water Cycle Change
  Terrestrial water storage (TWS), corresponding to integrated changes in surface water across rivers, lakes, wetlands, soil moisture, groundwater and snow, is a critical component of the global water and energy budget. The warming climate and other human disturbances are leading to more non-regular changes in terrestrial water storage, imposing emerging threats to water and food security.

  Identifying hot spot regions under non-stationary water cycle changes and exploring the drivers are important issues that may provide information to improve hydrological forecasting and water management. Through interdisciplinary research and data assimilation, the EIS team developed a **novel metric to quantify the non-stationarity of the global water cycle**, integrating data about long term trends, seasonal shifts, and interannual to sub-seasonal scale variabilities.

    ## Terrestrial water storage for Bangladesh
  Bangladesh is one of the hot spots regions that is experiencing non-stationary water cycle change, which is mainly evidenced by groundwater depletion from agricultural pumping. Averaged across the country, **TWS has depleted at a rate of almost 13 mm/year** during 2002-2021, or about 2 billion cubic meters per year countrywide.

  ### Changing landscape
  MODIS sensors can inform us about how land cover has changed over the past two decades. Cropland expansion has resulted in reduced native vegetation across the country. Satellite data also shows coastal land loss since 2001.

   Bangladesh lost about **490 square kilometers** of coastal land between 2001 and 2020, mainly caused by human-induced climate change combined with land subsidence. This chart shows annual coastal land loss from 2001 to 2020.

  ## Changing sea level
  Off the coast of Bangladesh, NASA's Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model shows the change in sea level from 1992 to 2017. This model uses information about ocean physics to fill in the gaps between satellite observations for a complete map of how sea-level change varies around the globe over time.

    The ECCO model shows that there are seasonal variations in sea-level change and a background increase of **3.6 mm/yr** over time. Sea-level rise compounds the risk of coastal flooding by raising the water level at river mouths and increasing flood magnitudes.separates total sea-level change into two components: extra water mass added to the ocean (barystatic) and ocean temperature and salinity changes (steric). At this location, the steric component remains steady over time, while the barystatic component is increasing, meaning that **sea-level rise off the coast of Bangladesh is driven by extra water mass added to the ocean from the ice sheets, glaciers, and changes to land-water storage**. Understanding the sources of past sea-level rise helps researchers create better projections of future sea-level rise.
