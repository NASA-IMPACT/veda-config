    ## Implications for Heat Stress

    Heat stress includes a series of conditions where the body undergoes stress due to overheating– typically from exposure to hot weather. It is a natural hazard that causes a large number of fatalities globally. Those at a greatest risk of heat stress include children, the elderly, and people with medical conditions, however, even young and healthy individuals can experience heat stress when exposed to intense heat or when conducting strenuous activities in hotter conditions. In the coming decades, climate change may cause more frequent heat waves, which could exacerbate heat-induced health issues. Future urban growth could also strengthen the urban heat island effect–in which infrastructure absorbs and re-emit the sun's heat at rates higher than natural landscapes–causing more severe heat events in urban populations.
    
    In urban areas a variety of individual, social, and geographic factors determine an individual's heat risk (Reckien et al. 2018). Social structures and segregation in urban areas can increase the risk of unequal heat exposure. This discovery will be using NASA Earth observations to explore heat stress inequalities throughout areas of urban growth in Houston, Texas over the past 20 years.

  ## Environmental inequality in Houston, TX
  Houston is the site of some of the earliest studies of environmental inequality. Robert Bullard, known as the “father of environmental justice,” proved that waste facilities were disproportionately sited in poor and minority neighborhoods as far back as the late 1970s (Bullard 1983). Today, environmental justice  research is still important in Houston, which is among the most racially segregated cities in the United States (Logan et al. 2013). In 2012, Houston was ranked the most economically segregated metropolitan area in the entire country (Fry and Taylor 2012). According to this study, 24% of high-income households live in high-income neighborhoods and 37% of low-income households reside in low-income neighborhoods (Fry and Taylor 2012).

    ### Using satellite data to study urban heat

    Using satellite data and socioeconomic information, a complete picture of Houston’s urban growth can be examined to further understand the impacts of heat stress. To study how the city is changing over time, land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) was used. This data classifies land cover types in areas as small as 30m x 30m every 3 years. Greenspace–a dedicated space for vegetation in an urban space, such as a park–also plays a big role in urban heat. To measure vegetation, such as trees and grass, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) metric is used. On this scale, bare ground = 0 and dense vegetation = 1. This information comes from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Terra platform.
    
    To study urban heat and surface temperature (LST), data from Terra MODIS was used. LST does not measure air temperature, but instead measures the temperature of the pavement. Increases in LST are generally associated with increases in air temperature and heat stress.

    The aggregation of this Earth science information is useful for understanding the geography of heat. To see the direct impact of heat stress in urban environments on humans, we need information regarding urban populations.The Center for Disease Control (CDC) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the CDC’sSocial Vulnerability Index (SVI)  were used to provide such information.

    ### Utilizing Land cover maps
    Using land cover maps, the increase of urban and built-up land-cover was measured. It was found that the area of urban and built-up land cover increased by more than 20% in the last two decades. By comparing land cover maps from 2001 and 2019, a substantial increase in urban areas along the southwestern part of the city can be seen (Figure 1 - slide to compare years).  A similar comparison can be done with average temperature. Figure 2 shows Houston’s average temperature from 2000-2009 compared to 2010-2019. The maps show higher average temperatures over similar regions in the southwestern part of the city. These higher temperatures carry into the night, too, although they are less intense.

    ### What it means for economically disadvantaged population
    When these changes in heat and land cover were combined with Houston's socioeconomic data, it was found that economically disadvantaged populations are subject to greater heat stress. At the same time, these populations may also face decreased access to greenspaces. In 2020, areas in Harris county with the lowest poverty levels < 5% were an average of  2°F (1°C) cooler than areas with higher poverty levels [F(4, 1584) = 47.3, p < .001].

    As with temperature, an analysis of 2020 vegetation data showed a significant difference based on levels of poverty [F(4, 27.5) = 4.57, p = .006]. Areas with the lowest poverty levels (< 5%) have approximately 6% more vegetation than areas with the highest poverty levels (>20%). Even small increases or decreases in vegetation can affect how residents experience heat.
