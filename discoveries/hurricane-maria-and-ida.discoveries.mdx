    ## Connecting Disaster Recovery with Environmental Justice: Hurricane María

    Hurricane María made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 or 5 hurricane on September 20, 2017, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. [Over 1.5 million people on the island lost power, leading to the longest blackout in US history](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218883). Although efforts to repair the damage on the island were extensive, the [areas with the most severe and prolonged impacts were areas of lower socioeconomic status](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218883). These communities lacked the resources and the representation to repair damage quickly, leading to long-term lack of access to electricity, water, and other critical supplies.

    NASA hosts a wide variety of continuous Earth observation data useful in environmental justice research. This dashboard features a selection of NASA datasets from across the Agency, including socioeconomic data, Earth observation analysis, and other combined datasets. These tools allow users to visualize and download data to understand the environmental issues brought on by Hurricane María. Merging Earth data and socioeconomic data can help communities like those in Puerto Rico to better prepare for and respond to future natural disasters.

    ## Connecting Disaster Recovery with Environmental Justice: Hurricane Ida

    Known as the city that can barely catch its breath between storms, New Orleans experienced another devastating event on August 29, 2021 as Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane. The effects of the storm were widespread, causing millions of dollars worth of damage and affecting the lives and homes of millions of people.

    [Disadvantaged communities](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02520-8) in Louisiana and across the country already struggle with higher rates of asthma, cancer, and COVID-19 infections. These communities are often hardest-hit by storms like Ida. Research has shown that disadvantaged communities often receive less federal aid than other communities, only prolonging their hardships. NASA is prioritizing open access to environmental justice data such as the datasets in this dashboard in an effort to help communities better prepare for and respond to natural disasters and to help shed light on cases of environmental injustice.

    ### Night Light Detection

    **Shining Light on the Aftermath of Hurricanes**

    30-meter resolution Black Marble HD nighttime lights were visualized for New Orleans, LA and Puerto Rico to highlight the impacts and recovery from the landfalls of Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Maria respectively. For each natural disaster, there is a pre-, during-, and post-event image for baseline comparisons. Within the night lights data layer, brighter areas indicate locations with higher light emissions. The observation data captures how the intensity and distribution of night lights changed during the recovery efforts.

    ### Flood Detection

    **Watching the Waters Recede**
    Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery shows the impact of flooding for Hurricanes Maria and Ida. This data supports disaster recovery and associated environmental justice issues as the degree and extent of flooding can be monitored in support of recovery efforts. The imagery displayed is a shortwave infrared (SWIR) false color composite that provides enhanced contrast to detect flood extent. In SWIR false color composite imagery, water is identified by dark blue colors, vegetation is bright green, clouds are white, and ice is blue.

    ### Blue Tarp Detection

    **Overview**

    The Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT), based at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, undertook an experimental study to determine if the application of artificial intelligence to NASA satellite images could accurately detect the number of blue tarps deployed on rooftops in the aftermath of hurricanes such as María and Ida as a way of predicting the relative severity of damage experienced by the respective local communities. Correlating these detections over time by zip codes and cross-referencing socio-economic data (such as that contained in the Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA) dashboard), relationships between socio-economic factors and disaster recovery can be identified.

    ## Approach

    The IMPACT machine learning team identified the bounding boxes for the New Orleans and San Juan regions. They ordered PlanetScope 3 band data from Planet Labs for dates before and after both hurricanes made landfall. They then combined all scenes available for the respective regions for each date. The scenes were segmented using shapefiles for each zip code in the metro areas. In the next step, the team used [US Building Footprints](https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) by Microsoft to limit the detections to just buildings and reduce false positives. A threshold for the color blue was defined and used to segment out blue pixels detected within the building footprints segmentations. For each of the above dates, the model counted the detection of blue pixelated building segments (interpreted to be blue tarps) in each zip code.

    ## "The Ground Truth"

    In order to establish an external benchmark, the team gathered local news reports published in the immediate aftermath of both Hurricane Ida and Hurricane María that included reports of damage. The news reports were grouped by the zip codes of the locations mentioned. Each reported zip code was then assigned an estimated level of damage severity. The damage experienced in a zip code was considered as:
    * low impact (L) if the reported damages were minor (e.g. dangling boards or tree debris);
    * medium impact (M) if the damages were significant but did not lead to complete loss of structures; or
    * high impact (H) if the damages were severe and led to complete loss of structures.

    A statistical analysis of the rankings demonstrates a high degree of correlation between the maximum number of detected blue tarp counts in each zip code and the level of estimated damage. The three instances where the order of rows should have been reversed, the difference in the blue tarp counts between each pair was not significant:

    * 70114(H) with 70119(M) p=0.177;
    * 70113(M) with 70130(L) p=0.452;
    * 00912(M) with 00901(L) p=0.478.

    Overall the number of detected blue tarps corresponded with the estimated amount of damage experienced by each zip code based on ground-level reports.

    However, when analyzing detected blue tarps as a percentage of total building footprints in each zip code, a similar pattern emerges that suggests the on-the-ground observations and damage assessments do not necessarily capture the complete picture.

    The graphs show a zip code in each of the areas affected by the hurricanes that were estimated as having sustained a low degree of storm damage: 70112 in New Orleans and 00901 in San Juan. As noted previously, in line with the on-the-ground reports, both rank low on the graphs showing the number of blue tarps detected.

    ## Findings and Future Avenues of Research

    The ability to detect blue tarp counts for the entirety of a zip code from satellite imagery holds the possibility of surfacing areas of relatively severe damage that may be obscured in ground-level observations. In both these zip codes the small absolute number of damaged buildings and significantly lower building footprint densities (i.e., 761.49/sq. km. in 70112 (p=0.0119) and 713.16/ sq. km. in 00901 (p=0.008)), may have caused these communities to be overlooked by on-the-ground coverage of the storm damage. However, as a percentage of total buildings, the damage sustained in both these zip codes was significantly underestimated by on-the-ground reports when compared to the highest ranked zip codes in medium damage estimate groupings (p=0.012 for 70112 and p=0.004 for 00901).

    These findings have potential environmental justice implications as zip code 70112 and 00901 share similar demographic profiles. Both zip codes are minority majority. The median household income for zip code 70112 is $20,457, and for 00901 it is $14,720 (65.7% and 47.3% the national median respectively). Both zip codes contain a higher than average population density:
    * 70112 contains 3,655 residents in a land area of 2.26 square kilometers (an effective density of 4,255/sq. mile).
    * 00901 contains 7,080 residents in a land area of 2.54 square kilometers (7,217/sq. mile).

    Both zip codes have indicators that suggest a high degree of multifamily housing. In zip code 70112, 2,563 housing units exist within 1,720 building footprints for an average ratio of 1.49 units per building. There are 4,990 housing units among the 1,810 building footprints in zip code 00901 for an average ratio of 2.76 units per building. In terms of population density, zip code 70112 has a ratio of 2.13 residents per building footprint, and zip code 00901 has 3.91 residents per building footprint. It follows from these residential densities that the number of people directly affected by even an apparently low number of damaged buildings (in terms of raw counts) is not insignificant.

    The environmental justice implications of being able to more quickly identify overlooked storm-damaged communities is considerable. Further research in this area can establish how satellite-based detections can inform and enhance disaster recovery efforts, especially in vulnerable communities.
