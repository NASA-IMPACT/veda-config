    Watching lava and magma flow from an erupting volcano may seem fascinating at first sight. But volcanoes emit dangerous gasses, including [sulfur dioxide](https://so2.gsfc.nasa.gov/so2intro.html) (SO₂), which can be toxic to the human body and the environment. 

    The most significant natural contributor to sulfur emissions is volcanic degassing, or when large amounts of gas escape through the soil near volcanoes. Volcanic gases are classified as air pollutants in many countries because of their effects on the human respiratory system.

    Tracking new and existing sources of SO2 is crucial because it affects environmental processes that directly impact our health, the global ecosystem, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. SO2 irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs. High concentrations of SO2 can result in temporary breathing impairment. Particle deposition from SO2 can damage stone and other materials, including culturally and historically significant objects such as statues and monuments. It can lead to acid rain, damaging foliage and hindering future growth. Volcanic-sourced SO2 contributes between one-quarter and one-third of total SO2 emissions. _Shown on the map: 2005 volcanic activity in the Galápagos islands._

    NASA’s instruments and satellites play a significant role in tracking gasses and emissions. Using satellite data, scientists and researchers have been able to track changes in SO2 emissions since 2005, building a catalog of significant SO2 sources and their emissions. This catalog helps update and improve “bottom-up” inventories used in air quality and climate models, evaluate the efficiency of industrial clean technology solutions in reducing air pollution, and monitor changes in SO2 emissions on a large scale. _Shown on the map: SO2 emissions detected on the Kamchatka Peninsula in 2009._

    Data is primarily collected from three sources: the OMI ([Ozone Monitoring Instrument](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html#:~:text=About%20OMI,data%20to%20derive%20tropospheric%20ozone.)) on the NASA [EOS Aura](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/) satellite since 2004; the [Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite](https://ozoneaq.gsfc.nasa.gov/omps/) (OMPS) on NASA-NOAA’s [NPP Suomi](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html) satellite, which launched in 2011; and the [Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument](http://www.tropomi.eu/) (TROPOMI) on the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite since 2017. These satellites retrieve SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from measurements in the UV part of the spectrum. The retrieved SO2 VCDs correspond to 1 km thick sulfur dioxide plumes near the surface. _Shown on the map: Eruption of Fagradalsfjall in Iceland in 2021._

    Volcanoes are not the only source of SO2; researchers closely monitor emissions from power plants, smelters (where metals are refined), and oil and gas industry-related sources. 

    The current catalog of major emissions consists of 759 sources, including 477 power plants, 74 smelters, 102 oil and gas-related sources, and 106 volcanoes. This steeply increased from the first catalog, introduced in 2016, which logged 491 sources. This increase can be attributed to the addition of TROPOMI data, which made it possible to track smaller sources. Emissions remained relatively stable for the first 15 years of tracking before declining to 40% in 2019-2021. This transformation can largely be attributed to a massive decline in emissions from volcanic sources in the Pacific: Kilauea in Hawaii; and Aoba and Ambrym in Vanuatu. The data indicates a decline of approximately 50% overall in global SO2 emissions between 2005 and 2021.

    ## The role of volcanic activity in sulfuric emissions

    The largest natural contributor to sulfur emissions is volcanic degassing, or when large amounts of gas escape through the soil near volcanoes. This contributes between one-quarter and one-third of total SO₂ emissions. Emissions remained relatively stable for the first 15 years of tracking before declining up to 40% in 2019-2021. This transformation can largely be attributed to a massive decline in emissions from strong volcanic sources in the Pacific from Kilauea in Hawaii and Aoba and Ambrym in Vanuatu.

   Six new volcanoes were added to the most recent catalog: Planchon-Peteroa in Argentina; Lascar in Chile; Makushin in Alaska; Ebeko in the Kuril Islands; Momotombo in Nicaragua; and La Palma in the Canary Islands. La Palma became active in 2021; however, its major eruption in September-December 2021 was not included in the catalog because the SO2 emissions were highly transient.

    For much of Earth’s history, volcanoes have been the primary source of SO2 emissions in the atmosphere. As industrialization spread across the globe, other SO2 emissions sources have eclipsed the relative impact of volcanic SO2. It is important to have resources like the SO2 Emissions Catalog to help us better understand the dynamics of SO2 emission sources.
