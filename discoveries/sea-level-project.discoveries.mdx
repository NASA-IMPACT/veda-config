    Gentle waves lapping at the shore of the ocean have drawn water-loving humans to coastal regions for generations. The ocean presents myriads of opportunities for seafaring, fishing, and other recreational activities. In recent decades, researchers have tracked the rapid rise of the oceans, which threatens the communities built around them. Rising sea levels bring more frequent and more severe flooding from high tides and storm surges to coastal communities. The damage extends to infrastructure like roads, bridges and buildings. Scientists estimate that melting ice sheets and glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica are responsible for up to one-third of the global average rise in sea level since 1993, jeopardizing seaside areas.     

    NASA has kept a keen eye on rising sea level by monitoring the contributions of melting ice sheets to the global oceans from space since 1978. Since 1991, the ice has been continuously observed by NASA, the U.S. Navy, the European Space Agency (ESA), and other international space agencies. Since 1993, NASA has collected laser altimetry measurements over the ice sheets to learn more about their topography. European radar altimetry missions such as ERS-1, ERS-2, and CryoSat-2 also provide uninterrupted monitoring of ice sheet height changes.

    Researchers use multiple methods of monitoring, including gravimetry (measuring mass), altimetry (measuring elevation), and the input-output method, to ensure the most accurate calculations. Using gravimetry measurements, scientists can calculate local differences in gravitational force solely from a change in ice mass. Satellite and airborne laser and radar altimetry also provide detailed surface topography and height changes of the ice sheets. These measurements are used to estimate changes in ice thickness and can be used to calculate how ice sheet mass has changed through time. The input-output method combines observations of actions that contribute to the total surface mass balance of the ice sheet (such as snowfall, rainfall, refreezing) and observations of ice being discharged into the ocean or lakes. Together, these three methods provide the most accurate picture of the current state of the ice sheets, as well as long-term predictions for future changes and contributions to sea level.
    [Note: If we have some specific data to speak to, we can make this section more detailed; otherwise it is best to cut it.]

    Though the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets can seem remote, their global influence is immense. The GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and GRACE Follow-On satellites are the result of a joint effort between NASA and the German Research Centre for Geosciences to measure variations in gravity over Earth’s surface from the constant redistribution of mass. GRACE measurements tell us that from 2002-2017, the melting ice sheets have contributed one-third of the total mean sea level rise, about 1.2 millimeters per year Warming Ocean water at lower elevations along ice sheet edges melts the ice, with the resulting meltwater to flow into the ocean. These ice sheets contain two-thirds of the world’s freshwater supply; the Greenland ice sheet, the largest in the Northern Hemisphere, holds enough water to raise the global mean sea level by 7.4 meters, while the Antarctic ice sheet, the largest ice mass on Earth, could increase sea level by 58 meters if it melted entirely. 

    While such massive sea level rise is a distant future possibility, the current rate presents immediate dangers to island nations and seaside communities, which can be devastated by floods and increasingly powerful storms. As technology advances, satellites and airborne instruments will be better equipped to improve observational coverage and accuracy over the ice sheets, leading to increased confidence in projections of future sea level rise. This real-time and historical data will aid governments and humanitarian organizations in decreasing the impact of disasters in coastal areas.
