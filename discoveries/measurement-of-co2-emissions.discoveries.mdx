    NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite has been tracking carbon dioxide emissions for more than 100 countries worldwide. Launched in 2014, the OCO-2 satellite maps natural and human-made carbon dioxide concentrations with the help of three camera-like spectrometers. An exciting [pilot project](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/963/2023/) based on top-down outputs from the OCO-2 offers a new perspective on carbon dioxide emissions. Importantly for achieving climate goals, it helps ascertain how much is absorbed by forests and other carbon-absorbing "sinks" within the borders of these countries.
    
    Carbon measurement methods that rely on activity-based approaches, also known as bottom-up approaches, involve calculating the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by various sectors of an economy, including transportation and agriculture. These traditional methods are essential for evaluating the progress made in reducing emissions, but creating them demands significant resources, expertise, and knowledge about the scope of the relevant activities.
    
    The study, which was conducted by over 60 international researchers, used measurements from the OCO-2 mission and surface-based observations to determine increases and decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from 2015 to 2020. By using this measurement-based approach, researchers were able to estimate how much carbon dioxide was emitted and removed in these countries.
    
    This new way of measuring carbon emissions is especially helpful for nations that lack traditional resources for carbon inventory development needed for the first global stocktake as specified in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The study provides data for more than 50 countries that have not reported emissions in the past 10 years. It also offers a new perspective by tracking both fossil fuel emissions and the total carbon "stock" changes in ecosystems, including trees, shrubs, and soils.

    NASA is focused on delivering Earth science data that addresses real world climate challenges – like 
    helping governments around the world measure the impact of their carbon mitigation efforts, said Karen St. 
    Germain, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

    This is one example of how NASA is developing and enhancing efforts to measure carbon emissions in a way that meets user needs

    The findings demonstrate that space-based tools can support Earth-based insights, as nations work to achieve climate goals. While traditional activity-based approaches to carbon measurement rely on estimating how much carbon dioxide is being emitted across all sectors of an economy, this new method offers an independent estimate of emissions and removals, providing a helpful check for consistency.
    
    The OCO-2 satellite, launched in 2014, uses three spectrometers to map natural and human-made carbon dioxide concentrations. These devices measure the gas indirectly based on how much reflected sunlight it absorbs in a given column of air. By tracking carbon dioxide emissions, we can better understand how human activity impacts the environment and how we can work to reduce our carbon footprint. This study offers a complex picture of carbon moving through Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere and provides valuable information to help us achieve our climate goals. 

    The study shows that emissions from deforestation alone account for a disproportionate amount of total carbon output in the Global South, which includes regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, while some other parts of the world have witnessed reductions in atmospheric carbon concentrations through improved land stewardship and reforestation. The authors stressed the importance of bottom-up methods in estimating carbon dioxide emissions and removals from ecosystems, but also noted that these methods are susceptible to uncertainty when data is lacking or the net effects of specific activities, such as logging, are not fully understood. 

    To address this, the study's top-down estimates provide an independent estimate of emissions and removals, which can check the consistency of the traditional bottom-up methods, although they cannot replace their detailed process understanding. Philippe Ciais, a study author and research director at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement in France, highlighted the significance of having both approaches for estimating carbon dioxide emissions and removals.

    Carbon is an important element that moves through Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere. Unmanaged ecosystems, such as tropical and boreal forests, can absorb carbon from the atmosphere, which can help to reduce the negative effects of global warming. While national inventories are designed to track how human activities impact carbon emissions and removals, they don't account for the carbon absorbed by unmanaged ecosystems. As a result, it's crucial to monitor the carbon balance of these ecosystems to identify any changes in carbon uptake. The researchers believe that their study can be improved to better understand how emissions from individual nations are changing in the future.
