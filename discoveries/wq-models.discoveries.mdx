  ## Introduction
    NASA’s Earth observations, can provide critical information on changing water quality across streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries. NASA Earth Information System developed a first-of-its-kind open science framework that can integrate Earth observations with process-based water quality simulations. This capability demonstrates how integrating the globally used ecosystem Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with NASA's Land Information System (LIS) expands our ability to understand water pollution trends given the increasing threats of climate extremes and human disturbances.

    ## Worsening Water Quality is Choking our Ecosystems

    The numerous rivers and streams across our nation are critical to sustaining human and aquatic life. But human activities and runoff from precipitation wash tons of fertilizer, sewage, sediment, and other pollutants into these waterways, diminishing the ecosystem services these waters provide, from clean drinking water to suitable habitat for fish.

    ## The Dead Zone
    
    Where the Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico, increased nutrients and sediment carried with the runoff contribute to hypoxia, a low-oxygen or “dead zone,” along the Texas-Louisiana shelf waters.

    With increasing agricultural runoff from extreme rainfall events and other sources, the size of this dead zone has expanded in recent years. This is a global problem, with more than 400 such hypoxic zones identified worldwide.

    ## Climate Change is Becoming Lethal to Aquatic Habitat

	Water quality problems are also worsening with recurring droughts and wildfires. Research shows that high stream temperatures and post-fire sediment runoff threaten native fish habitat in the western United States.

    ## Barrier to Solving Water Quality Problems ‒ Limited or No Data

	Across the more than two million rivers and streams in the Continental U.S., there are only a few hundred continuous water quality monitoring sites. This data gap limits our ability to understand where, when, and how worsening water quality will adversely impact human uses and aquatic health.

    ## A New NASA Model Brings Open Science to Target Water Quality Problems

    This EIS project is the first effort to integrate NASA’s Land Information System with a globally used process-based water quality simulation model - Soil & Water Assessment Tool.

    Comparing model results with ground observations shows the ability of this framework to predict water quality at high resolution river network-scales across the Mississippi River Basin. With a generalizable open science design, this framework can be reproduced for other major basins of the world.

    ## Summary

     By harnessing the power of Earth observations and models, NASA EIS is paving the way for a new open science paradigm that will lower traditional barriers of incomplete water quality data. 

     This new generalizable Earth observation-integrated water quality modeling framework will let researchers and stakeholders make more informed decisions on how to protect water quality against the growing threats of climate extremes and other human disturbances.
