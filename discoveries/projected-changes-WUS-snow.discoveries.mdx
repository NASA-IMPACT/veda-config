  ## Introduction
  üöß This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! üöß

  Over half of the annual runoff in the Western United States originates from seasonal snowpack. However, seasonal snowpack is threatened by future changes to climate. The impacts of climate change on snowpack are particularly important in mountainous regions, which behave like ‚Äúwater towers‚Äù, storing water in the winter, and releasing water through snowmelt in the spring and summer. In this discovery, we combine NASA-downscaled climate projections and [NASA land surface modeling tools](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) to investigate how climate change could impact snow water resources. We look at five mountainous domains in the Western U.S., and infer how changes to snow water resources could change the availability of wildlife habitat. This research was performed in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences.

  ## Climate change projections
   Climate projections came from the [Climate Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6). CMIP6 Projections of air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, and radiation were downscaled to finer spatial resolutions by the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections ([NEX-GDDP](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6)). Projections show that most of the Western US average winter air temperature and precipitation are expected to increase by the end of the century (2076 - 2095), relative to the historical timeframe (1995 - 2016).

    Average climate change signals were aggregated across 20-year periods at monthly timesteps. This was repeated for 23 different CMIP6 climate models, using two representations of future climate: 1) a ‚Äúmiddle of the road‚Äù projection with small progressions in environmental sustainability (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, SSP 2-4.5), and 2) a worst-case-scenario fossil-fueled future (SSP 5-8.5). The 23-model average monthly projected changes to the Washington North Cascades are shown in this chart.

    ## The Washington Cascades
    Montane snow in the pacific northwest is among the most sensitive in the Western US. As compared to internal US mountain ranges, this region is at lower elevations and has warmer temperatures and more-frequent winter rainfall.STATS

    ## Central and Southern Rocky Mountains
    Although temperatures are projected to increase by STAT by the end of the century, end-of-century winter precipitation is projected to increase, and winter temperatures may be sufficiently cold enough to sustain snowfall at high elevations. This could result in high-elevation increases in May 15 snowpack, particularly in Wyoming. However, projections often disagree on the direction of future snow changes in this region, and high elevation increases are not large enough to offset lower-elevation decreases in snow volume.
