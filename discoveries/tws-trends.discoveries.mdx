  ## Section 1: Introduction
  🚧 This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! 🚧

  Freshwater is what makes Earth habitable, sustaining ecosystems and human civilization. The global water cycle enables the supply of water and regulation of weather patterns. The cycling of water links the changes on land with the ocean and atmosphere. Challenges exist regarding the understanding of freshwater variability and availability because multiple earth systems interact with each other including processes that govern precipitation, ground soil moisture retention, snow cover, depth and melt, evapotranspiration and vegetation dynamics. Such processes become even more complex under human water intervention.

  The EIS team integrates the Noah-MP land surface model within NASA LIS framework (link) and remote sensing data sources by assimilating the earth observations of soil moisture from ESA CCI, leaf area index from MODIS, and terrestrial water storage anomalies from GRACE/GRACE-FO. With the data assimilation approach, the team provides a daily global water cycle reanalysis product for the period 2003-2021 at 10 km spatial resolution, which has the potential to better demonstrate surface and groundwater, human management influence, and hydrological extremes. The reanalysis data sets are publicly available and interactable via NASA VEDA interface, including key water, energy, and carbon fluxes such as terrestrial water storage and gross primary production . For more information, please visit the corresponding VEDA dataset page [LINK].

    ## Going through changes (testing...)
    Stationarity is gone for global hydrological water cycle under the warming climate and human disturbances. This imposes challenges in systems for hydrological forecasting and water management as those were designed and operated under the assumption of stationarity.

    Identifying the nature of non-stationarity of global water cycle is essential to understand the global distribution of water availability, changes in extremes, and to provide support on optimizing water systems.

    ## Seasonal Changes in TWS
    We provide a global assessment of the non-stationarity patterns in hydrological variables, including terrestrial water storage, evapotranspiration, and runoff.

    ## Where are the hotspots of nonstationarity?
    Evidence indicates a wide extent of seasonality shifts, long-term trends, variability intensifications and frequency changes in these fluxes. Our findings identify the hot spot regions that are experiencing strong non-stationary changes and discuss the associated attribution factors.
