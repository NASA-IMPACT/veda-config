  ## Section 1: Introduction
  ðŸš§ This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! ðŸš§

  Para 1: Motivation of the global water cycle reanalysis [capture human water footprint]
  
  Para 2: A brief ntro on methodology [TWS is modeled using Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) within LIS framework by assimilating NASA earth observations of soil moisture from ESA CCI, leaf area index from MODIS sensor, and TWS from GRACE/GRACE-FO. The modeled TWS is produced over global domain at a resolution of 10 km.
].

  Para 3: A brief intro to the output dataset [provide link to the VEDA Datasets]

    ## Going through changes (testing...)
    Stationarity is gone for global hydrological water cycle under the warming climate and human disturbances. This imposes challenges in systems for hydrological forecasting and water management as those were designed and operated under the assumption of stationarity.

    Identifying the nature of non-stationarity of global water cycle is essential to understand the global distribution of water availability, changes in extremes, and to provide support on optimizing water systems.

	  We develop a 10 km global gridded product of hydrological fluxes by assimilating satellite observed surface soil moisture, leaf area index, and terrestrial water storage anomalies into a land surface model within NASA Land Information System Framework.

    ## Seasonal Changes in TWS
    We provide a global assessment of the non-stationarity patterns in hydrological variables, including terrestrial water storage, evapotranspiration, and runoff.

    ## Where are the hotspots of nonstationarity?
    Evidence indicates a wide extent of seasonality shifts, long-term trends, variability intensifications and frequency changes in these fluxes. Our findings identify the hot spot regions that are experiencing strong non-stationary changes and discuss the associated attribution factors.

    We highlight the impact of human water use on water cycle non-stationarity and the need to incorporate satellite observation constraints in assessing the shifts in global water storage variabilities.

  ## Section 2: Scrollytelling Block 

  Refer to Shahryar's design for TWS trends...(TBD)

  [Key points: Switching between TWS_trend and GPP_trend, zoom in and out for a few locations that are under depletion and greening and explain why with reference links]
