  ## Section 1: Introduction
  ðŸš§ This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! ðŸš§

  Freshwater is what makes Earth habitable, sustaining ecosystems and human civilization. The global water cycle enables the supply of water and regulation of weather patterns. The cycling of water links the changes on land with the ocean and atmosphere. Challenges exist regarding the understanding of freshwater variability and availability because multiple earth systems interact with each other including processes that govern precipitation, ground soil moisture retention, snow cover, depth and melt, evapotranspiration and vegetation dynamics. Such processes become even more complex under human water intervention.

  The EIS team integrates the Noah-MP land surface model within NASA LIS framework (link) and remote sensing data sources by assimilating the earth observations of soil moisture from ESA CCI, leaf area index from MODIS, and terrestrial water storage anomalies from GRACE/GRACE-FO. With the data assimilation approach, the team provides a daily global water cycle reanalysis product for the period 2003-2021 at 10 km spatial resolution, which has the potential to better demonstrate surface and groundwater, human management influence, and hydrological extremes. The reanalysis data sets are publicly available and interactable via NASA VEDA interface, including key water, energy, and carbon fluxes such as terrestrial water storage and gross primary production . For more information, please visit the corresponding VEDA dataset page [LINK].

    ## The freshwater is trending
    Over the globe, the terrestrial water storage in many places is trending below the previous range, driven by independent or combined impact of natural variability, human groundwater pumping, and climate change.

    ## Irrigation induced groundwater depletion
    The vast agricultural regions such as the North China Plain and the Northwestern India are heavily irrigated, which mainly rely on groundwater pumping for irrigation. By integrating the GRACE/GRACE-FO terrestrial water storage anomalies, the global reanalysis is able to identify such hotspot depletion area.

    ## The Earth is greening
    Meanwhile, data from satellites indicate increasing greenness over the Earthâ€™s lands in recent decades (REF), highlighting the role of human land use in shaping the vegetation greening patterns.

    ## Human land management is a dominant driver of the greening Earth
    Cropland greening contributes the most to the net increase in leaf area globally (REF). Our reanalysis-based gross primary production reveals strong increasing trends in part of China and Indiaâ€™s croplands.

    ## Mutual effect on evapotranspiration
    The large-scale terrestrial water storage decline does not dry out from the surface down to the deep grounds. In fact, the repartition of water components due to human water management has wetted the surface due to irrigation, sustained the vegetation growth. The mutual effect has alleviated the trend in evapotranspiration. Assimilating multi-source remote sensing products has constrained both freshwater changes and the human impact on water-vegetation interactions.
