        "description": "Methane is a greenhouse gas emitted by a complex mix of natural sources and human activities. The structure of methane molecules makes the chemical compound particularly powerful at trapping heat: compared with carbon dioxide, methane can trap 80 times more heat over 20 years. These attributes make methane an attractive target for both public and private efforts to research and reduce emissions, with near-term benefits for global temperatures, air quality, and industrial efficiency.",

        "description": "Cities and metropolitan regions, where most of the world's population live, are responsible for approximately 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers are making rapid advances in urban emissions measurement and modeling to provide robust, accurate, and reliable emissions estimates at fine scales. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center offers an introduction to new urban-relevant datasets and highlights innovative emissions research in cities across the country.",
