description: "Difference between historical and current year observed vegetation cover at the date of maximum decrease (vegetation loss of 0-100%). This layer can be used to threshold vegetation disturbance per a given sensitivity (e.g. disturbance of â‰¥20% vegetation cover loss). The sum of the historical percent vegetation and the anomaly value will be the vegetation cover estimate for the current year."
