    Due to its immense size, the ocean’s carbon reservoir is roughly 20 times larger than the combined atmosphere and land reservoirs. The eventual fate of our atmospheric carbon emissions will be primarily in the oceans, as the ocean has absorbed roughly 40% of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO₂) since the beginning of the industrial era. How do we understand the details of how the ocean takes up carbon? It isn't easy — the ocean is vast, deep, and continually in motion. Even with ocean-observing satellites that orbit Earth 24/7, data from below the ocean surface is sparse. Data-driven estimates of how much carbon dioxide the ocean is absorbing (the so-called “ocean carbon sink”) have improved substantially in recent years. However, computational ocean models that include biogeochemistry continue to play a critical role as they allow us to fill critical gaps in data and understand the individual processes that control ocean carbon storage. The ideal scenario is a combination of the above two methods, where data are ingested and then used to improve a model's fit to the observed ocean, also known as “data assimilation”. While the physical oceanographic community has made great progress in developing data assimilation systems, for example, the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, the biogeochemical community has generally lagged behind. The ECCO-Darwin model represents an important technological step forward as it is the first global ocean biogeochemistry model that (1) ingests both physical and biogeochemical observations into the model in a realistic manner and (2) considers how the nature of the ocean carbon sink has changed over multiple decades. As the ECCO ocean circulation estimates become more accurate and lengthen in time, ECCO-Darwin will become an ever more accurate and useful tool for climate-related ocean carbon cycle and mitigation studies. This dataset contains global monthly averages of CO₂ flux between the ocean and the air from version 5 of the ECCO-Darwin model. The data are available at ~1/3° horizontal resolution at the equator (~18 km at high latitudes) from January 2020 through December 2022.

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    The techniques used for optimization of the ECCO-Darwin model, including assimilation of physical and biogeochemical observations, provide physically consistent and property-conserving ocean state estimates. The ECCO-Darwin model air-sea CO₂ fluxes showed general agreement with interpolation-based products, especially in subtropical and equatorial regions. The ECCO-Darwin time-mean global ocean CO₂ sink of −2.47 ± 0.50 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> (1995 - 2017) fits within the uncertainty of the Global Carbon Project estimate of −2.24 ± 0.76 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for the same period and agrees in magnitude and temporal variability with the interpolation-based models.

    ## Disclaimer
    This dataset has been transformed from the original format (NetCDF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ([COG](https://www.cogeo.org/)) for display in the US GHG Center. Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly.

    ## Scientific Details
    The ocean is a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), largely due to the presence of phytoplankton that use the CO₂ to grow. Studies have shown that global ocean CO₂ uptake has increased over recent decades however there is uncertainty in the various mechanisms that affect ocean CO₂ flux and storage and how the ocean carbon sink will respond to future climate change. Because CO₂ fluxes can vary significantly across space and time, combined with deficiencies in ocean and atmosphere CO₂ observations, there is a need for models that can correctly represent these processes. Ocean biogeochemical models (OBMs) have the ability to resolve the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms contributing to spatial and temporal variations in air-sea CO₂ fluxes but previous OBMs do not integrate observations to improve model quality and have not be able to operate on the seasonal and multi-decadal timescales needed to adequately characterize these processes. The ECCO-Darwin model is an OBM that assimilates Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium ocean circulation estimates and biogeochemical processes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Darwin Project. A pilot study using ECCO-Darwin was completed by [Brix et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.07.008) however an improved version of the model was developed by [Carroll et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001888) in which issues highlighted in the first model were addressed and adjustments were made to initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters in the model. This dataset contains the gridded global, monthly mean air-sea CO₂ fluxes from version 5 of the ECCO-Darwin model. The data are available at ~1/3° horizontal resolution at the equator (~18 km at high latitudes) from January 2020 through December 2022.

    The data assimilation techniques used for the physical and biogeochemical components of the ECCO-Darwin model are both linearized least squares minimization approaches. For ocean physics, ocean-ice state estimates from the ECCO LLC270 model were fit to observations including sea level anomalies, ocean bottom pressure anomalies, sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and ocean temperature and salinity profiles using an adjoint method. For ocean biogeochemistry, the MIT Darwin Project ecosystem model used a low-dimensional Green’s function optimization to adjust initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters. Using the paired ocean physics and biogeochemistry, air-sea CO₂ flux was calculated using the [Wanninkhof (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1029/92JC00188) parameterization for determining gas exchange across the air-sea interface.
