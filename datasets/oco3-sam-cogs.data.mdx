    description: "NASA-JPL's OCO-3 is an instrument onboard the International Space Station that measures carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. OCO-3 is similar in design to OCO-2 with the addition of the Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA) which essentially allows the instrument to focus its observations on the area surrounding a given location of interest on a single overflight. This is a fourth operation mode (along with the three operation modes of OCO-2) called Snapshot Area Mapping, or SAM, and is, along with target-mode observations, the focus of this product."
