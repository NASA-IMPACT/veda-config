    ## FEDs Fire Perimeters

    Fire perimeter data is generated by the FEDs algorithm. The FEDs algorithm tracks fire movement and severity by ingesting observations from the VIIRS thermal sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites. This algorithm uses raw VIIRS observations to generate a polygon of the fire, locations of the active fire line, and estimates of fire mean Fire Radiative Power (FRP). The VIIRS sensors overpass at ~1:30 AM and PM local time, and provide estimates of fire evolution ~ every 12 hours. The data produced by this algorithm describe where fires are in space and how fires evolve through time. This CONUS-wide implementation of the FEDs algorithm is based on [Chen et al 2020â€™s algorithm for California.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01343-0)

    ## Scientific Application Using FEDS Fire Perimeters
    FEDS Fire Perimeters offer insight into pre-fire risk, fire behaviour, and post-fire effects. The Earth Information System - Fire team is using FEDs perimeters to <Link to='/stories/fire-life-cycle'>understand the full lifecycle of a fire</Link>.
