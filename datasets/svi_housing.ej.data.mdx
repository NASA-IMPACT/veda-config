    The Housing Type & Transportation Score (HTTS) is one of the four themes used in determining a community’s social vulnerability, examining it against housing structure/type and vehicle access. As with the other SVI thematic areas, in the event of a disaster, or to better prepare for one, this dataset can help emergency personnel create an evacuation plan for individuals without vehicles, allocate emergency preparedness funding by community need, and identify areas in need of emergency shelters¹. It can also be used for local governments to identify areas needing more robust public transportation, areas of overcrowding, and local housing vulnerability. The HTTS SVI Grid is part of the U.S. Census Grids collection, and displays the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) SVI score. Funding for the final development, processing and dissemination of this data set by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)was provided under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)².

CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses 15 variables at the census tract level. The data comes from the U.S. decennial census for the years 2000 & 2010, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2014, 2016, and 2018. It is a hierarchical additive index (Tate, 2013), with the component elements of CDC’s SVI including the following for 4 themes: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, and Housing Type & Transportation.

SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract–subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.

## Scientific research
The Housing Type & Transportation Score (HTTS) is one of the four themes used in determining a community’s social vulnerability, examining it against housing structure/type and vehicle access. As with the other SVI thematic areas, in the event of a disaster, or to better prepare for one, this dataset can help emergency personnel create an evacuation plan for individuals without vehicles, allocate emergency preparedness funding by community need, and identify areas in need of emergency shelters¹. It can also be used for local governments to identify areas needing more robust public transportation, areas of overcrowding, and local housing vulnerability. The HTTS SVI Grid is part of the U.S. Census Grids collection, and displays the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) SVI score. Funding for the final development, processing and dissemination of this data set by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)was provided under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)².

## Interpreting the data
Interpreting the Data
Housing Type & Transportation Score displays the vulnerability in a given county tract based on housing type and transportation accessibility using values that range from 0 (less vulnerable) to 1 (more vulnerable). The score is broken down into several variables, all of which have been identified as areas of vulnerability for a community in the event of a disaster: number of multi-unit structures, mobile homes, level of crowding, vehicle accessibility, and grouped housing. Housing structure and quality are important factors in evaluating disaster vulnerability, as it is closely tied to personal wealth. Low-income communities often live in more poorly constructed houses or mobile homes that are especially vulnerable to strong storms or earthquakes³. The time, effort, and personnel that may be needed to evacuate crowded spaces can delay a community and the individual’s ability to avoid disasters or vulnerable situations. On the other hand, having access to reliable transportation can increase an individual’s ability to avoid vulnerable situations.
