  ### About

  The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Storm Events Database is a comprehensive archive of severe weather reports across the United States, including wind gust data collected from various sources. This dataset compiles observations from the National Weather Service (NWS), trained storm spotters, and automated surface observing systems (ASOS), providing detailed records of wind events, including peak gust speeds, locations, and associated impacts.

  By analyzing wind gust reports from the NCEI Storm Events Database, researchers can assess the spatial and temporal distribution of high-wind events, identify trends in extreme wind occurrences, and evaluate their impacts on infrastructure, transportation, and public safety. This dataset is particularly valuable for studying severe convective wind events, derechos, and other high-impact wind phenomena, helping to inform mitigation strategies and improve forecasting efforts.
