    NIST is engaged in research to improve measurement of greenhouse gas emissions in areas containing multiple emission sources and sinks, such as cities. NIST's objective is to develop measurement tools supporting independent means to diagnose the accuracy of greenhouse gas inventory data at urban and regional geospatial scales. NIST has established [three test beds in U.S. cities](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds) to develop and evaluate the performance of advanced measurement capabilities for emissions independent of their origin. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Los Angeles air basin of California, and the U.S. Northeast corridor (beginning with the Baltimore/Washington D.C. region), the test beds have been selected for their varying meteorology, terrain and emissions characteristics. These test beds will serve as a means to independently diagnose the accuracy of emissions data obtained directly from emission or uptake sources.

    A variety of data are collected at the test bed locations including station measurements of various GHG and trace gas species, airborne observations, weather data and modeling, lidar measurements, and observations from rawinsondes. Here, the GHG Center displays CO₂ and CH₄ concentration measurements from tower sites within the Indianapolis test bed location. This concentration data provides important continuous measurements of GHGs at the surface of the atmosphere which can be used to track trends over time, diurnal variations, and reveal how GHG concentrations change in relation to surrounding events and observations. While only tower concentration data is shown in the GHG Center, the complete urban testbed data collection can be accessed via NIST’s website: [https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds)

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    In lieu of a full assessment of the total uncertainty as it changes in time, the instrument uncertainty is characterized by the standard deviation of the reference gas error for a 31-day period (including 15 days prior to the measurement day and 15 days following the measurement day).  For more details, please see [Richardson, Miles, Davis et al. 2017](http://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.140).

    ## Scientific Details
    The Indianapolis urban test bed began in 2010 as the Indianapolis Flux Experiment, or INFLUX. INFLUX was designed to verify top-down methods for estimating fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by combining upwind and downwind measurements of radiocarbon, or 14CO₂, with an existing high-resolution fossil-fuel CO₂ inventory, Hestia, being developed at Purdue University by Prof. Kevin Gurney (now at Northern Arizona University). The original two tower sites (01 and 02) were the sampling locations for automated whole air samples in NOAA/GML flasks analyzed for 14CO₂ ([Turnbull et al., 2012](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/5/2321/2012/)). Additional flask sites and in-situ observations of CO₂, CH₄, and CO were added by NOAA/GML and Penn State University, respectively, and regular airborne sampling is conducted by Purdue’s Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research ([ALAR](https://www.science.purdue.edu/shepson/research/ALARGreenhouseGas/)). The goals of this experiment are to link bottom-up (activity-based) and top-down (atmosphere-based) emissions estimates of GHG emissions, and many resulting [publications](https://sites.psu.edu/influx/publications/) have focused on that goal. 

    The current INFLUX observation network includes twelve in-situ tower-based, continuous measurements of CO₂, CO, and CH₄ (although not all species will be measured at all sites), flask sampling of 14CO₂ and other trace gases, and periodic aircraft sampling of greenhouse gases and meteorological conditions. Only in-situ tower-based measurements of CO₂ and CH₄ are currently presented in the US GHG Center. Measurements are made with Picarro Inc. wavelength-scanned cavity ring down spectroscopic instruments at multiple levels. Hourly averages are reported here.
