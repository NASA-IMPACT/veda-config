    Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is defined as the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface. It includes surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, groundwater, snow, ice, water stored in the vegetation, river and lake water.

## Overview
Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is defined as the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface. It includes surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, groundwater, snow, ice, water stored in the vegetation, river and lake water.

## Modeling TWS  
TWS is modeled using Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) within LIS framework by assimilating NASA earth observations of soil moisture from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), leaf area index from MODIS sensor, and TWS from GRACE/GRACE-FO. The modeled TWS is produced over global domain at a resolution of 10 km.

## Interpreting the data
The TWS anomalies are calculated as differences of raw TWS with the climatology obtained over 2001-2021. Negative anomalies denote lower than normal TWS and vice-versa. The trend over time is thus deseasonalized and reflective of changes due to human impacts.
