  ### About

  Miller Type B cyclones are more complex, involving the interaction of two distinct low pressure systems. A primary low forms over the Midwest or Great Lakes regions, often producing light to moderate snowfall. As the primary low weakens, energy transfers to a secondary low-pressure system that develops near the Mid-Atlantic coast. This secondary low rapidly intensifies as it moves up the East Coast, often producing heavy snow for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Type B cyclones tend to bring mixed precipitation and ice to areas farther inland before transitioning to snow along the coast.
