    NIST is engaged in research to improve measurement of greenhouse gas emissions in areas containing multiple emission sources and sinks, such as cities. NIST's objective is to develop measurement tools supporting independent means to increase the accuracy of greenhouse gas emissions data at urban and regional geospatial scales. NIST has established [three test beds in U.S. cities](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds) to develop and evaluate the performance of advanced measurement capabilities for emissions independent of their origin. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Los Angeles air basin of California, and the U.S. Northeast corridor (beginning with the Baltimore/Washington D.C. region), the test beds have been selected for their varying meteorology, terrain and emissions characteristics. These test beds will serve as a means to independently diagnose the accuracy of emissions data obtained directly from emission or uptake sources.
    
    A variety of data are collected at the test bed locations including station measurements of various GHG and trace gas species, airborne observations, weather and surface fluxes, atmospheric profiling measurements including lidar measurements, and observations from rawinsondes. The interactive display below includes CO₂ and CH₄ concentration measurements from tower sites within the Northeast Corridor (NEC) test bed location. This concentration data provides important continuous measurements of GHGs in the atmospheric boundary layer which can be used, along with associated weather models, to reveal how GHG concentrations and, more importantly, urban emissions of GHGs change over space and time. While only tower concentration data is shown in the GHG Center, the complete NEC urban testbed data collection can be accessed via NIST’s website: [https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds)

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Uncertainty estimates on each hourly observation are estimated using algorithms detailed in Karion et al., 2020 ([https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-699-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-699-2020)) and included in each data file.

    ## Scientific Details
    The Northeast Corridor (NEC) Urban Test Bed Project was designed to demonstrate a scientifically robust measurement of total emissions and multi-year emission trends for carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) in an urban environment and attribute these trends to emissions from various sectors.  

    Continuous, in-situ measurements of CO₂, CH₄, and sometimes carbon monoxide (CO) dry air mole fractions (only CO₂ and CH₄ data are displayed in the GHG Center) are made from rooftops or towers in the Northeastern US region, including a dense network of towers in the Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland metro area. Most tower sites have measurements at multiple heights, but only measurements from the upper-most height are displayed in the GHG Center. 

    Measurements are reported on the NOAA/WMO X2007 (CO₂) and X2004A (CH₄) calibration scales. The CO₂ data will be updated to the NOAA/WMO X2019 calibration scale at a future date.
