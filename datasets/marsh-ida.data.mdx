  ### About

  Planet Labs’ SmallSat imagery, captured by the PlanetScope Dove satellite constellation, is a highly valuable commercial satellite remote sensing product, frequently leveraged for rapid damage assessment and environmental monitoring. Known for its frequent overpasses, with revisit times on the order of a couple of days, and an impressive spatial resolution of 3 meters, this imagery offers exceptional capabilities for monitoring changes in landscapes and infrastructure. The PlanetScope constellation has near-global coverage daily across the visible and near-infrared channels, providing extensive data for timely and precise analysis of up to 140-150 million square kilometers.

  ### What PlanetScope Data Offers

  * High-Resolution Imagery: With a 3-meter spatial resolution, the PlanetScope Dove satellite imagery provides detailed views of landscapes, enabling precise assessments of building and vegetation damage.
  
  * Frequent Revisit Times: The satellite constellation’s ability to capture imagery on the order of every couple of days makes it highly effective for monitoring rapid changes, such as those caused by natural disasters.
  
  * Extensive Coverage: Collecting up to 2 million square kilometers of imagery daily, the Dove constellation ensures broad coverage across visible and near-infrared channels.

  * Building and Vegetation Damage Assessment: The high-resolution and frequent imagery facilitate quick identification and analysis of damage to infrastructure and vegetation, aiding in damage determination and response efforts.
