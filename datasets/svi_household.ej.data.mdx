CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses 15 variables at the census tract level. The data comes from the U.S. decennial census for the years 2000 & 2010, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2014, 2016, and 2018. It is a hierarchical additive index (Tate, 2013), with the component elements of CDC’s SVI including the following for 4 themes: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, and Housing Type & Transportation.

SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract–subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.

## Scientific research
The Household Composition & Disability Score (HCDS) is one of the four themes used in determining a community’s social vulnerability. This dataset can be used to create a community evacuation plan accounting for individuals who have special needs, the elderly, and/or families with young children. In the event of a disaster, this data can also help responders determine the number of emergency personnel required for special household cases (accessibility assistance), the type of supplies needed based on age, and the amount of supplies, food, and other restorative resources needed¹. The HCDS SVI Grid is part of the U.S. Census Grids collection, and displays the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) SVI score. Funding for the final development, processing and dissemination of this data set by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)was provided under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)².

## Interpreting the data
The Household Composition & Disability score displays the vulnerability in a given county tract based on household composition using values that range from 0 (less vulnerable) to 1 (more vulnerable). The SVI is presented as a percentile that allows a tract to be compared directly to the tracts around it. Vulnerable household compositions were those identified as having residents who were aged 65 or older, aged 17 or younger, had a disability, and/or were a single-parent with children under the age of 18. People in any of these categories are more likely to require financial support, transportation, medical care, or assistance with ordinary daily activities during disasters and therefore have an increased vulnerability³. County tracts with a higher percentage of vulnerable household compositions were given higher SVI values.
