description: "NASA-JPL's OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2) is an Earth satellite mission to study the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide globally. Target mode makes observations focused on a single location on the surface as the satellite passes by, allowing for more highly detailed sampling of areas of particular interest."
