Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project from NASA is designed to integrate and harmonize data from multiple satellite sources, specifically the Operation Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8/9 and the Mult-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2A/B satellites. This project aims to create a seamless surface reflectance record that is essential for various Earth Observation and monitoring tasks.

- **Temporal Extent:** Landsat-9 2021-10-31; Sentinel-2B 2017-07-06
- **Temporal Resolution:** ~3 days
- **Spatial Extent:** Global with the exception of Antarctica
- **Spatial Resolution:** 30 m x 30 m 
- **Data Units:** Surface Reflectance 
- **Data Type:** Research
- **Data Latency:** 2 to 3 days


**Scientific Details:**  
HLS project incorporates several advanced scientific methodologies and technologies to harmonize data from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites such as atmospheric correction, geographic co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution normalization, and cloud-shadow masking. The calculation of entropy can be accomplished using the 'entropy' function from the 'scipy.stats' module, which computes the entropy of a distribution for given probability values. This function calculates the Shannon entropy. This metric quantifies the randomness or unpredictability inherent in the dataset's distribution from one time point to another.
