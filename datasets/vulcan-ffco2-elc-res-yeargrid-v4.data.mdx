    The Vulcan version 4.0 data product represents total carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel (ff) for the contiguous United States and District of Columbia. Referred to as ffCO₂, the emissions from Vulcan are also categorized into 10 source sectors including; airports, cement production, commercial marine vessels, commercial, power plants, industrial, non-road, on-road, residential and railroads. Data are gridded annually on a 1-km grid for the years 2010 to 2021. These data are annual sums of hourly estimates. Shown is the estimated total annual ffCO₂ for the United States, as well as the estimated total annual ffCO₂ per sector.

    The Vulcan Project is a multiagency (NASA, DOE, NOAA, NIST) funded effort under the North American Carbon Program (NACP) to quantify North American fossil fuel carbon dioxide (ffCO₂) emissions at space and time scales much finer than has been achieved in the past. The purpose is to aid in quantification of the North American carbon budget, to support inverse estimation of carbon sources and sinks, and to support the demands posed by higher resolution ffCO₂ observations (in situ and remotely sensed). The detail and scope of the Vulcan ffCO₂ inventory has also made it a valuable tool for policymakers, demographers, social scientists and the public at large.

    Gurney, K.R., J. Liang, R. Patarasuk, Y. Song, J. Huang, and G. Roest. 2019. Vulcan: High-Resolution Annual Fossil Fuel CO₂ Emissions in USA, 2010-2015, Version 3. ORNL DAAC, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1741

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Uncertainty in the ffCO₂ emissions were accounted for within each sector and quantified as the 95% confidence interval bounds. High and low bounds for each sector were gridded in addition to the mean emissions estimates. More information on uncertainty bounds are available in the peer-reviewed paper (see section 2). 
    
    The uncertainty of the Vulcan results are estimated by attempting to capture key input parameter variation. This is accomplished by completing a simulation with key input parameters (e.g. CO emission factor, CO₂ emission factor, CO emissions) set at their upper and lower range (an approximate 95% confidence interval). These two additional simulations estimated total annual domain ffCO₂ emissions as -14.0%/+16.6% of the central estimate for the example year of 2011. Two separate techniques are used to test the general quality of the Vulcan v3.0 ffCO₂ emissions estimate. The first is a comparison to other similar space/time-resolved ffCO₂ emission data products. Comparison to the ACES granular ffCO₂ estimate which only covers 13 Northeastern states was performed. In this comparison, total relative difference of 1.7% (ACES>Vulcan) was found, but much larger differences at the grid cell scale with a grid cell absolute median relative difference of 53.4%. Vulcan v3.0 results were also compared to the ODIAC global gridded ffCO₂ emissions data product which found a total relative difference of 6.9% (100.3 MtC/yr; Vulcan>ODIAC) in 2011. At the grid cell-scale a grid cell absolute median relative difference of 104.4% was observed. See Gurney et al. (2020) for more details. A second approach that compared the results presented here to atmospheric CO₂ inverse estimates was performed. At the whole contiguous US spatial scale and annual temporal scale, the 2010 Vulcan results were within 1.4% of an atmospheric 14CO₂ inversion effort (Basu et al., 2020).
    
    ## Disclaimer
    This dataset has been transformed from the original format (GeoTIFF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ([COG](https://www.cogeo.org/)) for display in the US GHG Center. Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly.

    The Vulcan data product is an attempt to estimate fossil fuel CO₂ (ffCO₂) emissions at fine time and space scales. It should be considered a “climatology” of emissions rather than the “weather” of emissions. This means that the estimates represent “typical” emissions at a specific time and place (average conditions). Hence, it is not considered appropriate to use in comparison to short-term “campaign” style atmospheric measurements (e.g. 5 days of continuous monitoring at a specific location) without consideration of the mismatch between the measurement and the Vulcan estimation approach.   
    
    ## Scientific Details
    Vulcan covers 10 emission source sectors and is constructed from numerous public datasets that generate the emissions’ magnitude in addition to space and time distributions. The ffCO₂ emissions are estimated at a mixture of spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g., polygons, points, lines, annual, hourly) depending upon the characteristics of the incoming data sources and spatialization/temporalization techniques. Hence, some sources receive spatial and temporal “conditioning” (e.g., downscaling, interpolation, proxy surrogates) to arrive at the mix of spatial resolutions (point, polylines, polygons) and hourly resolution for each of the years spanning the 2010-2021 period. The emissions are typically gridded to spatial resolutions coarser than 0.5km x 0.5 km and temporal resolutions coarser than hourly. Please refer to the [Vulcan data derivation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCwFoMdDy8xGJ-zcdX8IkNwo6cEwFc7E7Xu47IgE2Ik/edit?usp=sharing) for further detail on the methods for estimating emissions in the largest sectors: electricity production, industrial, on-road, and residential/commercial emissions. Methods for the remaining sectors: airport, railroad, commercial marine vessels, non-road, and cement can be found in [Gurney et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD032974) which describes the previous version of Vulcan, [Vulcan v3.0](https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1741).
