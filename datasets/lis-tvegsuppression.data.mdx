    ## About
    
	Change in vegetation transpiration for 2020 fires using model outputs from Land Information System (LIS) framework that synthesizes multiple remote sensing observations within the Noah-MP land surface model. Change is calculated as the difference of transpiration in the immediate post-fire water year from that in the immediate pre-fire water year. The difference is normalized by pre-fire transpiration and negative values denote vegetation disturbance induced by fire or by a climatological anomaly resulting in the decline in transpiration.
