description: "The MODIS Level-1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture\
  \ radiances for 36 discrete bands located in the 0.4 \xB5m to 14.4 \xB5m region\
  \ of the electromagentic spectrum. These data are generated from MODIS Level-1A\
  \ scans of raw radiance, and in the process are converted to geophysical units of\
  \ W/(m2 \xB5m sr). In addition, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function\
  \ (BRDF) may be determined for the solar reflective bands (1-19, 26) through knowledge\
  \ of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser data, and\
  \ from the target illumination geometry). Additional data are provided including\
  \ quality flags, error estimates and calibration data."

  description: The MODIS Brightness Temperature (Band 31, Day) layer is the brightness
    temperature, measured in Kelvin (K), calculated from the top-of-the-atmosphere
    radiances. It does not provide an accurate temperature of either clouds or the
    land surface, but it does show relative temperature differences which can be used
    to distinguish features both in clouds and over clear land. It can be used to
    distinguish land, sea ice, and open water over the polar regions during winter
    (in cloudless areas).
