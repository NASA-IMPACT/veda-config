    The ocean is a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), largely due to the presence of phytoplankton that use the CO₂ to grow. Studies have shown that global ocean CO₂ uptake has increased over recent decades however there is uncertainty in the various mechanisms that affect ocean CO₂ flux and storage and how the ocean carbon sink will respond to future climate change. Because CO₂ fluxes can vary significantly across space and time, combined with deficiencies in ocean and atmosphere CO₂ observations, there is a need for models that can correctly represent these processes. Ocean biogeochemical models (OBMs) have the ability to resolve the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms contributing to spatial and temporal variations in air-sea CO₂ fluxes but previous OBMs do not integrate observations to improve model quality and have not be able to operate on the seasonal and multi-decadal timescales needed to adequately characterize these processes. The ECCO-Darwin model is an OBM that assimilates Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium ocean circulation estimates and biogeochemical processes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Darwin Project. A pilot study using ECCO-Darwin was completed by Brix et al. (2015) however an improved version of the model was developed by Carroll et al. (2020) in which issues highlighted in the first model were addressed and adjustments were made to initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters in the model. The updated ECCO-Darwin model was compared with interpolation-based products to estimate air-sea CO₂ flux. This dataset contains the gridded global, monthly mean air-sea CO₂ fluxes from version 5 of the ECCO-Darwin model. The data are available at ~1/3° horizontal resolution at the equator (~18 km at high latitudes) from January 2020 through December 2022.
    
    - **Temporal Extent:** January 2020 - December 2022
    - **Temporal Resolution:** Monthly    
    - **Spatial Extent:** Global    
    - **Spatial Resolution:** Approximately 1/3° x  1/3° (at the equator)    
    - **Data Units:** Millimoles of CO₂ per meter squared per second (mmol m²/s)
    - **Data Type:** Research
    - **Data Latency:** 


    **Scientific Details:** The data assimilation techniques used for the physical and biogeochemical components of the ECCO-Darwin model are both linearized least squares minimization approaches. For ocean physics, ocean-ice state estimates from the ECCO LLC270 model were fit to observations including sea level anomalies, ocean bottom pressure anomalies, sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and ocean temperature and salinity profiles using an adjoint method. For ocean biogeochemistry, the MIT Darwin Project ecosystem model used low-dimensional Green’s function optimization to adjust initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters. Using the paired ocean physics and biogeochemistry, air-sea CO₂ flux was calculated using the Wanninkhof (1992) parameterization for determining gas exchange across the air-sea interface.

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    The techniques used for optimization of the ECCO-Darwin model, including assimilation of physical and biogeochemical observations, provide physically consistent and property-conserving ocean state estimates. The ECCO-Darwin model air-sea CO₂ fluxes showed general agreement with interpolation-based models, especially in subtropical and equatorial regions. The ECCO-Darwin time-mean global ocean CO₂ sink of −2.47 ± 0.50 Pg C year−1 (1995 - 2017) fits within the uncertainty of the Global Carbon Project estimate of −2.24 ± 0.76 Pg C year−1 for the same period and agrees in magnitude and temporal variability with the interpolation-based models.
