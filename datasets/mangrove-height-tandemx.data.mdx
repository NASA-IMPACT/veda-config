     Realistic estimates of water and energy cycle variables are necessary for accurate understanding of earth system processes. We develop a 10 km global reanalysis product of water, energy, and carbon fluxes by assimilating satellite observed surface soil moisture, leaf area index, and terrestrial water storage anomalies into a land surface model within NASA Land Information System Framework. We applied a seasonal and trend decomposition algorithm to get the trend estimates for terrestrial water storage and gross primary production. The method can better help to deal with [nonstationarities](https://github.com/Earth-Information-System/sea-level-and-coastal-risk/blob/main/AMS_2023_Wanshu_Nie_for_VEDA_Discovery.pdf) and seasonal shifts and provide a more robust estimate of trends.
