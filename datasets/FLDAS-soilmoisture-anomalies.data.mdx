FLDAS is the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System. The goal of FLDAS is to use observational and forecast datasets and advanced modeling methods to generate high quality fields of land surface states and fluxes used for FEWS NET decision support. The FLDAS systems are custom instances of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) that have been adapted to work with the domains, data streams, and monitoring and forecast requirements associated with food security assessment in data-sparse, developing countries. Surface soil moisture anomalies are an indicator of wet and dry extremes that have the potential to impact agricultural and food security outcomes.

**Scientific Details:**  
The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah 3.6.1 model. The data are in 0.10 degree resolution and range from January 1982 to present. The temporal resolution is monthly and the spatial coverage is global (60S, 180W, 90N, 180E). The simulation was forced by a combination of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) daily rainfall data that has been temporally downscaled using the NASA Land Data Toolkit. The simulation was initialized on January 1, 1982 using soil moisture and other state fields from a FLDAS/Noah model climatology for that day of the year. Soil moisture anomalies are computed based on monthly averages from 1982-2016.

## Dataset Accuracy
This dataset uses CHIRPS precipitation inputs and MERRA-2 reanalysis. While regional, relative, comparisons to remotely sensed estimates and other model products are favorable, users should verify that the data accuracy meets the requirements of their specific application, and interpret results accordingly.
