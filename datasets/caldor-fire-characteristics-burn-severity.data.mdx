  ## About
  This dataset describes the progression and active fire behavior of the 2021 Caldor Fire in California, as recorded by the algorithm detailed in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01343-0. It includes an extra layer detailing the soil burn severity (SBS) conditions provided by the [Burned Area Emergency Response](https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/baer/) team.

    The BARC has four classes of burn severity which include: high, moderate, low, and unburned. "Warm" colors indicate higher severity (red = "high" and yellow = "moderate") and "cool" colors indicate lower severity ("low" and "unburned"). Color definitions for each class are available in the [attribute table](https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/baer/node/2046) for GeoTIFFs and in legends associated with other graphic products.

    This map then serves as a key component in the subsequent flood modeling and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis. The BARC data is meant to be used as a main input into the development of a final soil burn severity map.
