    Future changes to precipitation are expected to alter the volume and timing of snow water resources. Here, we present the projected percent-change to Western US cumulative winter precipitation at quarter-degree spatial resoutions across 20-year time periods between 2025 and 2085. Projections are averaged from an ensemble of 23 downscaled climate models from the CMIP6 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections.

## Overview
Future changes to precipitation are expected to alter the volume and timing of snow water resources. Here, we present the projected percent-change to Western US cumulative winter precipitation at quarter-degree spatial resoutions across 20-year time periods between 2016 and 2095. Projections are averaged from an ensemble of 23 downscaled climate models from the [CMIP6 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6).
