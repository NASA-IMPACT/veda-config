  ## Scientific Details
  The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total Column layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally. This information is used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.<br />

  Sulfur/Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) is one of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) six major regulated criteria pollutants (Tropospheric Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Lead, PM2.5 and PM 10 particulates). It irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs. High concentrations of SO2 can result in temporary breathing impairment. It is produced by combustion of coal, fuel oil, and gasoline, since these fuels contain sulfur in the combustion, and in the oxidation of naturally occurring sulfur gases. It is a precursor to sulfuric acid, which is a major constituent of acid rain. SO2 is injected into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions. SO2 also is a major precursor to PM2.5, which is a significant health concern, and a main contributor to poor visibility.

## Interpreting the data
Global total column SO2 observations are generated using a principal component analysis algorithm using a single observation in the planetary boundary layer. The single observation is obtained from the "best pixel" of the level-2 OMI/Aura SO2 total column observations for the observation day. SO2 observations in support of air quality are available from 2005-2021 at 0.25 x 0.25 degree spatial resolution. Higher concentrations of SO2 are shaded in yellow and lower concentrations in purple.
