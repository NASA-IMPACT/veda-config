## Overview
Snow water equivalent (SWE) is defined as the amount of water in the snow. It is expressed as a height (in millimeters), representative of the height of water that would exist if snow was only in a liquid state.

## Modeling SWE
SWE is modeled using Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) within LIS framework. A baseline simulation was developed to represent 20-year median snow evolution between 1995 and 2014. The baseline simulation was then perturbed using monthly climate change signals to air temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation, wind, and surface pressure. SWE projections in future timeframes represent the median of a 23-member ensemble of simulations performed using climate change signals from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6) with downscaling from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6). The modeled SWE is produced at 1 km spatial resolutions.
