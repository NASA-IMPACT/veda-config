    The Minority Status & Language Score (MSLS), as with the other SVI thematic areas, is used to calculate a community’s social vulnerability. This data set can be used to prepare emergency plans for communities with lower English-proficiency levels¹, and has helped contribute to efforts such as the Minority Health SVI and its related Dashboard. The Minority Health SVI is an extension of the CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (CDC/ATSDR SVI), which is a database that helps emergency response planners and public health officials identify, map, and plan support for communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a public health emergency². The MSLS SVI Grid is part of the U.S. Census Grids collection, and displays the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) SVI score. Funding for the final development, processing and dissemination of this data set by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) was provided under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)³.

CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses 15 variables at the census tract level. The data comes from the U.S. decennial census for the years 2000 & 2010, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2014, 2016, and 2018. It is a hierarchical additive index (Tate, 2013), with the component elements of CDC’s SVI including the following for 4 themes: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, and Housing Type & Transportation.

SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract–subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.

## Interpreting the data
The MSLS vulnerability rank in a given county tract is based on minority status and level of English proficiency, using values ranging from 0 (less vulnerable) to 1 (more vulnerable). Communities with English proficiency levels classified as “ Less than Well” and/or with more individuals identifying as minorities had higher SVIs and are therefore more vulnerable. For individuals with limited English proficiency, disaster communication may be increasingly difficult and the marginalization of certain racial and ethnic groups (including real estate discrimination) has left these communities in areas of higher vulnerability⁴.
