     Realistic estimates of water and energy cycle variables are necessary for accurate understanding of earth system processes. We develop a 10 km global reanalysis product of water, energy, and carbon fluxes by assimilating satellite observed surface soil moisture, leaf area index, and terrestrial water storage anomalies into a land surface model within NASA Land Information System Framework. We applied a seasonal and trend decomposition algorithm to get the trend estimates for terrestrial water storage and gross primary production. The method can better help to deal with [nonstationarities](https://github.com/Earth-Information-System/sea-level-and-coastal-risk/blob/main/AMS_2023_Wanshu_Nie_for_VEDA_Discovery.pdf) and seasonal shifts and provide a more robust estimate of trends.

    Mangrove wetlands are among the most productive and carbon-dense ecosystems in the world. Their structural attributes vary considerably across
    spatial scales, yielding large uncertainties in regional and global estimates of carbon stocks. This study offers a baseline to monitor national and regional
    trends in mangrove carbon stocks [Simard et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0279-1).

    This dataset characterizes the global distribution, biomass, and canopy height of mangrove-forested wetlands based on remotely sensed and in situ field
    measurement data. Estimates of (1) mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB), (2) maximum canopy height (height of the tallest tree), and (3) basal-area
    weighted height (individual tree heights weighted in proportion to their basal area) for the nominal year 2000 were derived across a 30-meter resolution
    global mangrove ecotype extent map using remotely-sensed canopy height measurements and region-specific allometric models. Within designated plots, selected trees were identified to species and diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height was
    measured using a laser rangefinder or clinometer. Tree density (the number of stems) can be estimated for each plot and expressed per unit area. These
    data were used to derive plot-level allometry among AGB, basal area weighted height (Hba), and maximum canopy height (Hmax) and to validate the
    remotely sensed estimates.

    This dataset has been transformed from its original format (GeoTIFF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) for display in the US GHG Center. Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly. 
    

    ## Scientific Details

    Uncertainty was addressed by calibration with [ICESat/GLAS Spaceborne Lidar](https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/glas.php) mission data, refining the range of elevation data identified as mangrove
    cover, and subsequent validation by field data. The study only included areas with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation values ranging
    from 0 to 55 m to eliminate inland areas over-classified as mangrove wetlands.<br/>

    The relationship between SRTM and Basal Area Weighted Height (Hba) had a correlation coefficient R2 value of 0.78 and RMSE of 3.60 m at global
    scales. Additionally, SRTM values versus field measurements of max height (Hmax) had a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.70 and RMSE of 5.80 m
    globally. Analysis of canopy height variance obtained from SRTM, lidar, and field measurements demonstrated that SRTM height characterizes mean
    overstory canopy height and maintains consistency over time when measuring canopy height in established mangrove forests. Regional biomass
    allometric models developed for this study had a combined RMSE of 57.2 Mg ha-1 (ranging from 46.6 Mg ha-1 to 72.0 Mg ha-1) and an R2 of 0.77. The
    global biomass allometric model had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 87.9 and correlation coefficient R2 of 0.62. See Simard et al. (2019) for more
    details.
