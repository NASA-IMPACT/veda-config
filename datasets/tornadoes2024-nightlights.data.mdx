description: "NASAâ€™s Black Marble night lights dataset provides satellite images of Earth at night, capturing the light pollution from cities, roads, and other human activity. These images are collected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, and can be used to examine changes in illumination over time. In this story, night lights data is used to assess changes before and after a tornado impacts a town, highlighting areas affected by power outages that may cause recovery slowdowns."
