In partnership with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University, Meta [formerly known as Facebook] used census data and computer vision techniques (Convolutional Neural Networks) to identify buildings from publicly accessible mapping services to create population density datasets. These high-resolution maps estimate the number of individuals living within 30-meter grid tiles on a global scale. The population estimates are based on data from the Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4) data collection.

## Scientific research
The 30-meter resolution population density dataset uses machine learning techniques to produce global population maps using building footprints and census population data from CIESIN. The high resolution population data can be used to support the applications community when assessing the impacts of natural disasters or assessing risk at near global coverage.

## Interpreting the data
Population density is provided in units of people per square meter, at the near global scale and is available for the year 2015. The data is gridded at 30m resolution and is only available in locations where buildings are present (i.e. there will be no data over large parks or industrial areas). Higher population density regions (shaded in red) typically correspond to urban centers and lower population (in yellow) to rural and suburban locations.
