description: "Canopy heights of mangrove-forested wetlands globally for 2015 at 12-m resolution. Estimates of maximum canopy height (height of the tallest tree) were derived from the German Space Agency's TanDEM-X data that produced global digital surface models. Also provided are Lidar estimates of canopy height based on the GEDI instrument, which were used for training and validation of the TanDEM-X estimates of forest height"

      ## Disclaimer
      Uncertainty in the methane (ppm-m) depends on instrument, observation, and surface factors as described in the [ATBD](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1696/EMIT_GHG_ATBD_V1.pdf) by Broderick, et al. 2023. An uncertainty value (ppm-m) is calculated and reported for each plume complex. As described in the ATBD, EMIT plume complexes are manually identified and reviewed. While we publish high confidence examples, false positives can occur and when identified these cases are removed from subsequent data releases.
