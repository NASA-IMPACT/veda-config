CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses 15 variables at the census tract level. The data comes from the U.S. decennial census for the years 2000 & 2010, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2014, 2016, and 2018. It is a hierarchical additive index (Tate, 2013), with the component elements of CDC’s SVI including the following for 4 themes: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, and Housing Type & Transportation.

SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract–subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.

## Scientific research
The Economic Status Score, like the three other themes, is used in observing a community’s social vulnerability. As with other SVI scores, the economic status score can help local officials and teams identify communities that will need continued support to recover following an emergency or natural disaster¹. The Economic Status SVI Grid is part of the U.S. Census Grids collection, and displays the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) SVI score. Funding for the final development, processing and dissemination of this data set by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) was provided under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)².

## Interpreting the data
The Socioeconomic Status score displays the vulnerability in a given county tract based on poverty level, employment, income, and education level using values that range from 0 (less vulnerable) to 1 (more vulnerable). Of these variables, tracts with more individuals who are below the poverty level, unemployed, lower-income, and have no high school diploma are identified as more vulnerable³. Conversely, as income, education, and level of employment increase, the social vulnerability for a tract decreases. Likely, communities with higher education and employment levels are exposed to higher income opportunities and often have access to resources that are preventative (well-structured housing, extra supplies), accessible (vehicles, medical attention, spacious) and responsive (higher communication levels, faster recovery rates).
