  ## About
  Snow water equivalent (SWE) is defined as the amount of water in the snow. Here, we present the projected SWE and percent-change to projected snow in future periods, relative to the historical period (1995 - 2014). 

  We have examined two different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) which describe potential future scenarios based on decisions in climate policies and actions as well as human infrastructure and governance. We have gathered the SSP2-4.5 which represents an intermediate radiative forcing pathway and the SSP5-8.5 representing a future with a high radiative forcing.

  ## Scientific Details
  SWE is modeled using Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) within LIS framework. A baseline simulation was developed to represent 20-year median snow evolution between 1995 and 2014. The baseline simulation was then perturbed using monthly climate change signals to air temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation, wind, and surface pressure. SWE projections in future timeframes represent the median of a 23-member ensemble of simulations performed using climate change signals from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6) with downscaling from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6). The modeled SWE is produced at 1 km spatial resolutions.
