    Methane (CH₄) emissions from wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of methane in the global CH₄ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and anthropogenic emissions. Wetland CH₄ is produced by microbes breaking down organic matter in the oxygen deprived environment of inundated soils. Due to limited data availability, the details of the role of wetland CH₄ emissions has thus far been underrepresented. Using the Wald Schnee und Landschaft version (LPJ-wsl) of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) global CH₄ emissions from wetlands are estimated at 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution by simulating wetland extent and using characteristics of these inundated areas, such as soil moisture, temperature, and carbon content, to estimate CH₄ quantities emitted into the atmosphere. Highlighted areas displayed in this dataset show concentrated methane sources from tropical and high latitude ecosystems. The LPJ-wsl Wetland Methane Emissions data product presented here consists of global daily and monthly model estimates of terrestrial wetland CH₄ emissions from 1980 - 2021. These data are regularly used in conjunction with NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, to compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions.

    **Scientific Details:** For this dataset, wetlands are defined as land areas that are either permanently or seasonally saturated, excluding small ponds, lakes, and coastal wetlands. Permanent wetlands comprise three general types: mineral wetlands (swamps and marshes), peatlands (permafrost, bog, fens), and seasonally flooded shallow water (floodplains). The methane-producing area is thus linked to inundation and freeze−thaw dynamics, which change geographically and temporally in response to soil water dynamics. Wetland emissions of CH₄ are estimated as a function of substrate, soil temperature, and soil moisture. The net flux of CH₄ is defined as the heterotrophic respiration for the area of a grid cell covered by wetland, scaled by a fixed ratio of soil carbon to CH₄ emissions and by a modifier that varies the CH₄ emission intensity for different biomes. The LPJ-wsl land surface model uses a two-layer bucket model to simulate soil hydrology and uses a modified version of the topography-based hydrological model (TOPMODEL) to determine the likely distribution and dynamics of permafrost and inundated areas. The monthly data uses climatic observations from meteorological stations developed by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), University of East Anglia as the input climate forcing data to the model. Input climate forcing data for the daily data comes from 1 hourly reanalysis Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) data.

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Shifting spatial patterns of vascular plants affect the transport of CH₄ from soil into the atmosphere. The absence of this effect from the LPJ-wsl model could lead to underestimation of CH₄ emissions. Additionally, the biogeographical distribution of methane-producing microbes and the mechanisms by which they grow and generate byproducts may have a significant impact on CH₄ emissions but are not well understood, adding additional uncertainty to current models. Uncertainties in radiative forcing estimates also contribute to model output uncertainty.  

    ## Disclaimer
    All data provided in the GHG Center has been transformed from the original format (NetCDF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ([COG](https://www.cogeo.org/)). Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly. The NetCDF data were obtained from the following directories:
    - [Monthly data](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gmaoftp/lott/CH4/wetlands/) 
    - [Daily data](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gmaoftp/lott/CH4/wetlands/daily/)  

    Note that the source dataset is provided in units of kilograms of methane per meter squared per month (kg CH₄ m2/mon) or day (kg CH₄ m2/day) but has been converted to **grams** of methane per meter squared per month (g CH₄ m2/mon) and day (g CH₄ m2/day) in the COG format provided in the GHG Center for the purpose of improved visualization.
