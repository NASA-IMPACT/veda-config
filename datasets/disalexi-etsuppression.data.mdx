    High resolution observations of ET from OpenET (DisALEXI model) captures the impact of fires on vegetation. Large declines in post-fire standardized ET anomalies are observed (left) that correspond well with burn scars from the MTBS burn severity dataset (right) during the fire year 2020.

    ## About
    
    Impact of fires on changes in evapotranspiration, obtained OpenET observations (DisALEXI model) for 2017-20 fires
    
    Changes in ET are calculated as the difference of ET in the immediate post-fire water year from ET in the immediate pre-fire water year. The difference is normalized by pre-fire ET and negative values denote vegetation disturbance induced by fire or by a climatological anomaly resulting in the decline in ET
