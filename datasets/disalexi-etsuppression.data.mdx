    ## About
    
    Impact of fires on changes in evapotranspiration, obtained OpenET observations (DisALEXI model) for 2017-20 fires
    
    Changes in ET are calculated as the difference of ET in the immediate post-fire water year from ET in the immediate pre-fire water year. The difference is normalized by pre-fire ET and negative values denote vegetation disturbance induced by fire or by a climatological anomaly resulting in the decline in ET
