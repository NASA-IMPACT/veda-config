    **Spatial extent:** Global    
    **Spatial resolution:** 0.5° x 0.5°<br />

    Methane (CH₄) emissions from vegetated wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of methane in the global CH₄ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and anthropogenic emissions. Wetland CH₄ is produced by microbes breaking down organic matter in the oxygen deprived environment of inundated soils. Due to limited data availability, the details of the role of wetland CH₄ emissions have thus far been underrepresented. Using the Earth Observation SIMulator  version (LPJ-EOSIM) of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) global CH₄ emissions from wetlands are estimated at 0.5 x 0.5 degree spatial resolution. By simulating wetland extent and using characteristics of inundated areas, such as wetland soil moisture, temperature, and carbon content, the model provides estimates of CH₄ quantities emitted into the atmosphere. The LPJ-EOSIM Wetland Methane Emissions dataset consists of global daily and monthly model estimates of terrestrial wetland methane emissions from 1990 to the present, with data added every two months. The monthly dataset is computed by summing the daily data for each month. The estimates are regularly used in conjunction with NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, to compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions. This is a new version and replaces the LPJ-wsl dataset previously available in the GHG Center.

    ## Source Data Product Citation
    The following four citations encompass the data used in creating the visualizations of the LPJ-EOSIM data in the US GHG Center.

    The daily and monthly low latency datasets listed indicate the data delivered more frequently throughout the year using estimated carbon dioxide input data. Once the carbon dioxide input data has been finalized, the daily and monthly products are permanently published to the high latency collections.

    ## Version History
    Notice: Due to ERA5 driver issues, the LPJ-EOSIM ERA5 and ensemble mean estimates of wetland methane were updated on November 14, 2024. Affected data covered July 1, 2024 to November 14, 2024. If data in this range were previously used, we recommend re-downloading /re-accessing the data.


    The current dataset version is LPJ-EOSIM v1, which replaced LPJ-wsl v1 in the US GHG Center in April 2024. Summary of version update changes:
    - Model updates and improvements, including improved data latency with more regular updates and driver-specific model recalibration
    - Addition of two new data layers: LPJ-EOSIM model estimated wetland methane emissions using ERA5 climate input forcing data, and using the mean of both MERRA-2 and ERA5 climate input forcing data (mean ensemble). The LPJ-wsl dataset only provided estimates using MERRA-2 climate input forcing data until the end of 2021. 
    - LPJ-EOSIM data is obtained directly from the LP DAAC in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format (LPJ-wsl data was in NetCDF format and transformed to COG)
    - LPJ-wsl data remains accessible from the [GMAO website](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gmaoftp/lott/CH4/wetlands/) 
    - In October 2024, the version of the dataset in the GHG Center was changed from LPJ-EOSIM v2 to LPJ-EOSIM v1 to match the version of the source dataset in the NASA EOSDIS Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). This was a correction of the version number only, and does not represent any changes to the underlying data.  
    
    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Shifting spatial patterns of vascular plants affect the transport of CH₄ from soil into the atmosphere. The absence of this effect from the LPJ-EOSIM model could lead to the underestimation of CH₄ emissions. Additionally, the biogeographical distribution of methane-producing microbes and the mechanisms by which they grow and generate byproducts may have a significant impact on CH₄ emissions but are not well understood, adding additional uncertainty to current models. Uncertainties in radiative forcing estimates also contribute to model output uncertainty. Care should be taken when running analyses, as these data are model simulations and not Earth observations. 
    
    The wetland CH₄ data presented here have been subjected to rigorous quality checks, including comprehensive benchmarking against ground-truth model simulations and observations. Each file has been visually and programmatically checked for outliers or missing data, but errors can still occur. In the event of a reprocessing, a note will be posted on this website and the dataset will be updated. 
    
    ## Scientific Details
    For this dataset, wetlands are defined as land areas that are either permanently or seasonally saturated, excluding small ponds, lakes, and coastal wetlands. Permanent wetlands comprise three general types: mineral wetlands (swamps and marshes), peatlands (permafrost, bog, fens), and seasonally flooded shallow water (floodplains). The methane-producing area is thus linked to inundation and freeze−thaw dynamics, which change geographically and temporally in response to soil water dynamics. Wetland emissions of CH₄ are estimated as a function of substrate, soil temperature, and soil moisture. The net flux of CH₄ is defined as the heterotrophic respiration for the area of a grid cell covered by wetland, scaled by a fixed ratio of soil carbon to CH₄ emissions and by a modifier that varies the CH₄ emission intensity for different biomes. The LPJ-EOSIM land surface model uses a two-layer bucket model to simulate soil hydrology and uses a modified version of the topography-based hydrological model (TOPMODEL) to determine the likely distribution and dynamics of permafrost and inundated areas. Input climate forcing data comes from two different data products: the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 1 (MERRA-2) data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA5). This LPJ-EOSIM dataset contains 3 data layers: two wetland methane emission estimates forced by MERRA-2 and ERA5 respectively, and a mean ensemble data layer which is computed as the mean of the two wetland datasets forced by MERRA-2 and ERA5. The ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets differ in how they represent variables such as precipitation and temperature, which affects wetland methane estimates in LPJ-EOSIM. The ensemble mean product is recommended for use as it has performed better against known data, as measured by the [ILAMB](https://www.ilamb.org/) benchmarking tool, than the two constituent MERRA-2 and ERA5 data products.
