    As part of the global stock take (GST), countries are asked to provide a record of their greenhouse gas emissions to inform decisions on how to reduce GHG emissions. The NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) team has used remote sensing observations from Japan’s Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) to produce modeled total methane (CH₄) emissions and uncertainties on a 4 degree (latitude) by 5 degree (longitude) resolution grid for the years 2010 - 2022. The GOSAT data is used in the model to inform total emission estimates, as well as wetland (the primary natural source of methane). These estimates are expressed in teragrams of CH₄ per year (Tg/year). Only the total and wetlands model-derived emissions are included in the US GHG Center. The source dataset contains emissions data for all other anthropogenic sources.

    ## Version History
    This data product (v1) was updated in the US GHG Center in December 2024. Updates include:
    - Data added for 2010 - 2022 (previously, data was only provided for 2019)
    - Change in spatial resolution from 1° x 1° to 4° (latitude) x 5°(longitude)
    - Removal of uncertainty and priori data layers (priori model-estimated methane emissions for wetlands remains accessible via the [US GHG Center STAC Catalog](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/earth.gov/ghgcenter/api/stac/?.language=en))
    - Updated layer names and descriptions 
   
    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Data accuracy is determined by understanding the uncertainties in the model emissions. Bottom-up uncertainties are generally calculated by comparing how emissions attributions to each sector differ across studies, by comparing emission models and remote sensing data, and using expert opinion when uncertainties are especially challenging to estimate. Recent studies show that there could be larger than expected emissions from aquatic and fossil fuel sources. This means that current methane budgets estimated from both bottom-up and top-down models are either inaccurate in their allocations to existing sectors or that the atmospheric methane removal mechanisms (sinks) are not fully understood. 
    
    For top-down uncertainties, recent studies also show that there can be considerable errors in the models used by remote sensing instruments to relate measurements to concentrations. Model transport errors can add additional uncertainty when inverting concentrations to fluxes. The flux inversion used for this top-down dataset reduces the impact of variability in the hydroxyl radical (OH), the main driver of methane removal, on methane emissions by jointly estimating OH and CH₄ emissions. A latitudinal correction is used to reduce the impacts of stratospheric chemistry and transport errors. Other systematic errors in model transport and chemistry were not characterized but it is not expected that these errors are significant. Additionally, the Bayesian approach used for this dataset enables the quantification of smoothing error, which can be a significant contributor to emission uncertainty, and reduces the potential for introducing additional uncertainty and biases when fluxes are projected back to emissions. 

    ## Disclaimer
    This dataset has been transformed from the original format (NetCDF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ([COG](https://www.cogeo.org/)) for display in the US GHG Center. Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly.  
    
    The [original source dataset](https://ceos.org/gst/methane.html) contains CH₄ emissions layers for various anthropogenic sources that are not presented in the US GHG Center. The [original source data](https://ceos.org/gst/methane.html) also contains a .csv text format file with CH₄ emissions listed by country. Note that uncertainties are only appropriate for use at the grid cell  (i.e. 1 degree) resolution. Care must be taken when using or interpreting this data.

    ## Scientific Details
    These wetland and anthropogenic fluxes, derived using atmospheric concentration data from the GOSAT model, demonstrate that wetlands are a primary driver of atmospheric methane increases from 2010 through 2022. In particular, substantial growth of both (wetland emissions and atmospheric methane) during 2019 and 2020, occurred as a result of increased inundation of African wetlands. Anthropogenic emissions also play a role in increasing atmospheric methane with these data pointing towards livestock emissions a likely driver. These results are published in [Qu et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2402730121).
