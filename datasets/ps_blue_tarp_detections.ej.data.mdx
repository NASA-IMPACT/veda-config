    PlanetScope provides 3-band RGB imagery at 3-meter ground resolution which
    can support building-scale analysis of the land surface. In the aftermath of
    natural disasters associated with high wind speeds, homes with damaged roofs
    typically are covered with blue tarps to protect the interior of the home
    from further damage. Using machine learning, blue tarps can be detected from
    the PlanetScope imagery using pre-event cloud free images to detect blue
    pixels and potential impacts after a natural disaster.

    ## Scientific Details<br /> 
    Detection of blue tarps from high resolution imagery
    can inform disaster response of the most impacted locations. Additionally,
    given the frequency with which PlanetScope scenes are retrieved from the
    satellite, the rate of recovery for a given location can also be tracked
    over time. This can also support disaster response to provide aid to
    specific locations where recovery efforts are lacking.

    ## Interpreting the data<br />
    Machine learning-based detections of blue tarps are
    displayed as red pixels on the basemap and are available for both Hurricane
    Maria (2017) and Hurricane Ida (2021). The input true color imagery used to
    produce the detections are also added as an additional layer and can be used
    for qualitative validation of the detections.
