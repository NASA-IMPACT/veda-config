    In order to examine how the fire event affected the changes in surface properties, we utilized the MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, and land surface temperature (LST) products for a six-year period centered on the Camp Fire event (2015-2022). We used these products which are available at 16-day intervals to compute monthly averaged spatial maps of NDVI, albedo, and LST. The monthly average spatial maps were then averaged over the areas affected by the Camp Fire to compute monthly mean values. This dataset is the Albedo WSA difference portion of that analysis.
