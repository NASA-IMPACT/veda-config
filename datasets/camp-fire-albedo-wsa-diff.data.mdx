    In order to examine how the fire event affected the changes in surface properties, we utilized the MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo (WSA), and land surface temperature (LST) products for a six-year period centered on the Camp Fire event (2015-2022). We used these products which are available at 16-day intervals to compute monthly averaged spatial maps of NDVI, albedo, and LST. The monthly average spatial maps were then averaged over the areas affected by the Camp Fire to compute monthly mean values. This dataset is the Albedo WSA difference portion of that analysis.

    Satellite observations show that loss of vegetation caused by the Camp Fire leads to an average decrease in night time LST of 0.35 &deg;C (0.64 &deg;F). Locally, decreases in night time LST can be as much as 1.5 &deg;C.

    [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/land-surface/land-use-land-cover/land-use-land-cover-classification/vegetation-index-0): A numerical value used to predict or assess vegetative characteristics such as plant leaf area, total biomass, and general health and vigor of the surface vegetation.

    [White Sky Albedo (WSA)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/land-surface/surface-radiative-properties/albedo): The ratio of sunlight reflected from the land surface to sunlight reaching the land surface.

    [Land Surface Temperature](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/land-surface/surface-thermal-properties/land-surface-temperature): How hot the “surface” of Earth would feel to the touch in a particular location.
