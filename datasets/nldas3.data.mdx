    This sample dataset presents a fine scale precipitation analysis from the development of NLDAS-3. NLDAS-3 is currently under development and the final product will include precipitation fields (included here) as well as other surface meteorology such as temperature, radiation, surface pressure, and wind speed. NLDAS-3 represents the next generation (i.e., phase 3) of the North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2). NLDAS-3 precipitation has been derived by assimilating daily precipitation amounts at 4 km of the NASA Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurements GPM (IMERG) and the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) into the NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2). NLDAS-3 precipitation at 4 km and daily time steps was then downscaled to 1 km using a cloud-cover based algorithm based on datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) then converted to hourly using a temporal disaggregation which employs MERRA-2 and IMERG datasets. NLDAS-3 covers North and Central America (from latitude 7 to 72 North and longitude 169 to 52 West) at a resolution of 0.01. The sample data available from this page are monthly-averages and an initial version of the still-in-development of the NLDAS-3 precipitation.
