  ### About

  Miller Type A cyclones form along the Gulf Coast or in the southern United States, where warm, moist air from the Gulf of America meets colder Arctic air descending from the north. These storms then travel along the East Coast, often intensifying as they near the Northeast U.S., as they tap into additional moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. Type A cyclones tend to bring widespread, heavy snowfall to the densely populated I-95 corridor or interior Northeast. Their direct development along the Gulf provides an abundant moisture source, resulting in potentially significant impacts for the Southeastern U.S., the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast.
