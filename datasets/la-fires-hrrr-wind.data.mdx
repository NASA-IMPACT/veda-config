  ### About

  The High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a NOAA NCEP operational weather prediction system that provides high-resolution, rapidly updated atmospheric simulations. HRRR is widely used for forecasting severe weather, wildfires, and high-impact weather events. This dataset specifically captures 10-meter wind gusts around the time of ignition for the Eaton and Palisades Fires in Los Angeles, California.

  ### What HRRR Model Data Offers

  * High-Resolution Wind Forecasts: HRRR provides 3 km spatial resolution, making it one of the most detailed real-time wind prediction models available for the U.S.
  * Rapid Updates: The model runs hourly, updating every hour with new observations for more precise forecasting.
  * Critical for Wildfire Analysis: HRRR wind forecasts assist in predicting fire spread, behavior, and firefighter safety considerations.
  * Operational Use: HRRR is relied upon by meteorologists, emergency response teams, and researchers for real-time and retrospective analysis of severe weather events.
