## Overview

On Monday, September 11, 2023, the city of Darnah, Libya experienced the [deadliest flood disaster of the 21st century](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/environment/floods-in-libya-s-derna-worst-disaster-in-21st-century/2992617&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1709231595507737&usg=AOvVaw3MuRygRSSxtExzI_shVddG), and Africa’s deadliest flood ever recorded. A storm in the Mediterranean Sea dubbed ‘Medicane Daniel’ moved over northeastern Libya on the evening of the 10th, dumping prolific rain over the desert the morning of the 11th. A record 16” of rainfall was measured in 24 hours at the city of Al-Bayda, Libya (just west of Derna) from ‘Medicane’ Daniel. Two dams upstream of Darnah collapsed during the heavy rains leading to approximately [25% of the city being destroyed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-than-1000-bodies-recovered-libyan-city-after-floods-minister-2023-09-12/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1709231595509452&usg=AOvVaw083l0kMybsbbwT18u4SVTm). The first dam broke around 3:00 AM local time on September 11th, and the second followed suit shortly thereafter, which exacerbated the death toll greatly. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that proceeding the dam bursts, a wave as high as 23 feet (7 meters) rushed towards the city. With a population of 120,000, the major city of Darnah saw massive destruction, with entire districts of the city being washed away.Nearly 1,000 buildings are estimated to have been completely destroyed as well as 5 major bridges that connect the west and east sides of the city. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs initially reported a death toll currently sits at 11,300 with another 10,100 reported missing. This estimate was later revised to [3,958 fatalities](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/libya-floods-conflicting-death-tolls-greek-aid-workers-die-in-crash) on September 18.

## Scientific Research

The main dataset utilized in analyzing the Darnah flood is a three-band HLS composite image generated from the shortwave infrared, narrow near-infrared, and red bands of pre and post-flood HLS data. These scenes were acquired on September 7 and 22, 2023. The SWIR false color composite provides a visually compelling representation of the extent of the greenup resulting from the heavy rainfall leading to the flood, and also highlights areas of sediment loading from the desert after compared to before the flood.

This dataset supports ongoing scientific research and analysis of the Darnah flood and its aftermath, including assessing the flood's impact on the local land cover and vegetation extent, the monitoring of long-term recovery of the local environment and ecosystem, and even evaluation of the effectiveness of flood mitigation and dam rebuilding efforts upstream of Darnah.

## Interpreting the Data

The HLS dataset concerning the Darnah Flood should be interpreted with a special consideration of the temporal, spatial, and environmental aspects.

Temporal Aspects: The HLS SWIR FalseColor composite images were taken at 10:30 AM LST on September 7 and 22, 2023, which correspond to pre and post-flood times.

Spatial Aspects: All three bands used from the HLS dataset are at 30 meter resolution.

Environmental Aspects: When interpreting the data, it is essential to consider the local topography and land cover. Darnah lies along the southern coast of the Mediterranen Sea, with rapidly rising terrain just to its south. The city is located in the Saharan Desert.
