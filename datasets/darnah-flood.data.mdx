## Overview

On Monday, September 11, 2023, the city of Darnah, Libya experienced the [deadliest flood disaster of the 21st century](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/environment/floods-in-libya-s-derna-worst-disaster-in-21st-century/2992617&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1709231595507737&usg=AOvVaw3MuRygRSSxtExzI_shVddG), and Africa’s deadliest flood ever recorded. A storm in the Mediterranean Sea dubbed ‘Medicane Daniel’ moved over northeastern Libya on the evening of the 10th, dumping prolific rain over the desert the morning of the 11th. A record 16” of rainfall was measured in 24 hours at the city of Al-Bayda, Libya (just west of Derna) from ‘Medicane’ Daniel. Two dams upstream of Darnah collapsed during the heavy rains leading to approximately [25% of the city being destroyed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-than-1000-bodies-recovered-libyan-city-after-floods-minister-2023-09-12/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1709231595509452&usg=AOvVaw083l0kMybsbbwT18u4SVTm). The first dam broke around 3:00 AM local time on September 11th, and the second followed suit shortly thereafter, which exacerbated the death toll greatly. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that proceeding the dam bursts, a wave as high as 23 feet (7 meters) rushed towards the city. With a population of 120,000, the major city of Darnah saw massive destruction, with entire districts of the city being washed away.Nearly 1,000 buildings are estimated to have been completely destroyed as well as 5 major bridges that connect the west and east sides of the city. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs initially reported a death toll currently sits at 11,300 with another 10,100 reported missing. This estimate was later revised to [3,958 fatalities](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/libya-floods-conflicting-death-tolls-greek-aid-workers-die-in-crash) on September 18.

## Scientific Research


The primary dataset employed in analyzing the Darnah flood, alongside Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrivals for the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM IMERG) data, is a three-band HLS composite image created from the shortwave infrared, narrow near-infrared, and red bands of pre and post-flood HLS data, supplemented with total rainfall data from GPM taken from 5 to 16 September 2023. These scenes were acquired on September 7 and 22, 2023. The SWIR false color composite visually illustrates the extent of the greenup resulting from heavy rainfall leading to the flood, while GPM's total rainfall data provides insight into precipitation patterns associated with Medicane Daniel over the eastern Mediterranean region.

These datasets support ongoing scientific research and analysis of the Darnah flood and its aftermath. They aid in assessing the flood's impact on local land cover, vegetation extent, sediment loading, and precipitation patterns. Furthermore, they facilitate the monitoring of long-term environmental recovery and ecosystem resilience, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of flood mitigation and dam rebuilding efforts upstream of Darnah.

## Interpreting the Data

The HLS  and GPM datasets concerning the Darnah Flood should be interpreted with careful consideration of temporal, spatial, and environmental factors.

Temporal Aspects: The HLS SWIR FalseColor composite images were taken at 10:30 AM LST on September 7 and 22, 2023, corresponding to pre- and post-flood times. The GPM total rainfall data is a summed daily rainfall accumulation product that spans from September 5 to 16, 2023.

Spatial Aspects: All three bands used from the HLS dataset are at 30-meter resolution, providing detailed spatial information. GPM's total rainfall data covers the entire eastern Mediterranean region, offering insights into the broader spatial distribution of precipitation associated with Medicane Daniel, and is at 0.1 by 0.1 degree spatial resolution.

Environmental Aspects: When interpreting the data, it is crucial to consider the local topography and land cover. Darnah, situated along the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, experiences rapidly rising terrain to its south and lies within the Saharan Desert region.
