    This dataset comes from the two decadal COGs that displayed mean Aerosol Optical Depth for 2000-2009 and for 2010-2019. Those tiffs were subtracted to display the differences between the two decades.

    ## About

    MODIS-calculated Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) difference over the Houston metro area. This dataset comes from the two decadal COGs that displayed mean Aerosol Optical Depth for 2000-2009 and for 2010-2019. Those tiffs were subtracted to display the differences between the two decades.
    Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an assessment of the amount of visible and infrared light aerosols scatter or absorb in a column of the atmosphere, and is sometimes referred to as aerosol optical thickness. AOD is a unitless measure. From an observer on the ground, an AOD of less than 0.1 is characteristic of a clear sky, bright Sun, and maximum visibility. As AOD increases to 0.5, 1.0, and greater than 3.0, aerosols become so dense that the Sun is obscured.
