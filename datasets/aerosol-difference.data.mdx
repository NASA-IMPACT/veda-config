    This dataset comes from the two decadal COGs that displayed mean Aerosol Optical Depth for 2000-2009 and for 2010-2019. Those tiffs were subtracted to display the differences between the two decades.

  Refer to the "houston-aod" dataset for more information on how AOD Difference is derived. This dataset comes from the two decadal COGs that displayed mean Aerosol Optical Depth for 2000-2009 and for 2010-2019. Those tiffs were subtracted to display the differences between the two decades.
