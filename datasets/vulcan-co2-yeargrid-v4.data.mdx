    Vulcan v3.0 is the first bottom-up inventory to report FFCO2 plus cement production CO2 fluxes at 1-km resolution for all major carbon-emitting sectors across the entire United States landscape. Vulcan v3.0 is constructed from numerous public datasets that generate the magnitude, spatial representation, and temporal representation of FFCO2 emissions.

    The source data can be accessed from the ECCO Data Portal: [https://data.nas.nasa.gov/ecco/](https://data.nas.nasa.gov/ecco/)

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    The techniques used for optimization of the ECCO-Darwin model, including assimilation of physical and biogeochemical observations, provide physically consistent and property-conserving ocean state estimates. The ECCO-Darwin model Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissionses showed general agreement with interpolation-based products, especially in subtropical and equatorial regions. The ECCO-Darwin time-mean global ocean CO₂ sink of −2.47 ± 0.50 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> (1995 - 2017) fits within the uncertainty of the Global Carbon Project estimate of −2.24 ± 0.76 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for the same period and agrees in magnitude and temporal variability with the interpolation-based models.

    ## Disclaimer
    This dataset has been transformed from the original format (NetCDF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ([COG](https://www.cogeo.org/)) for display in the US GHG Center. Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly.

    ## Scientific Details
    The ocean is a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), largely due to the presence of phytoplankton that use the CO₂ to grow. Studies have shown that global ocean CO₂ uptake has increased over recent decades however there is uncertainty in the various mechanisms that affect ocean CO₂ flux and storage and how the ocean carbon sink will respond to future climate change. Because CO₂ fluxes can vary significantly across space and time, combined with deficiencies in ocean and atmosphere CO₂ observations, there is a need for models that can correctly represent these processes. Ocean biogeochemical models (OBMs) have the ability to resolve the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms contributing to spatial and temporal variations in Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissionses but previous OBMs do not integrate observations to improve model quality and have not be able to operate on the seasonal and multi-decadal timescales needed to adequately characterize these processes. The ECCO-Darwin model is an OBM that assimilates Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium ocean circulation estimates and biogeochemical processes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Darwin Project. A pilot study using ECCO-Darwin was completed by [Brix et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.07.008) however an improved version of the model was developed by [Carroll et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001888) in which issues highlighted in the first model were addressed and adjustments were made to initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters in the model. This dataset contains the gridded global, monthly mean Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissionses from version 5 of the ECCO-Darwin model. The data are available at ~1/3° horizontal resolution at the equator (~18 km at high latitudes) from January 2020 through December 2022.

    The data assimilation techniques used for the physical and biogeochemical components of the ECCO-Darwin model are both linearized least squares minimization approaches. For ocean physics, ocean-ice state estimates from the ECCO LLC270 model were fit to observations including sea level anomalies, ocean bottom pressure anomalies, sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and ocean temperature and salinity profiles using an adjoint method. For ocean biogeochemistry, the MIT Darwin Project ecosystem model used a low-dimensional Green’s function optimization to adjust initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters. Using the paired ocean physics and biogeochemistry, Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissions was calculated using the [Wanninkhof (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1029/92JC00188) parameterization for determining gas exchange across the air-sea interface.
