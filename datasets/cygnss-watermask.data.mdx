## Background
ðŸš§ Here, the CYGNSS Inundation Working Group is working to visualize and assess different surface water mapping products developed by multiple teams. Products are developed using a variety of techniques at different spatial and temporal resolutions. ðŸš§

Surface water mapping is a critical observational need to support not only effective disaster response but also effective water resource management through better understanding of water availability and variability. Observations from the bistatic L-band CYGNSS observing system are enabling new approaches to estimate properties of surface water coverage especially in regions of dense vegetation. The CYGNSS inundation working group is leveraging
the VEDA dashboard and analytics to better understand tradeoffs between algorithmic approaches and the quality of data products.

Current data products include those produced by the following teams contributing to the CYGNSS Inundation Working Group:
UCAR, PI Clara Chew (currently at Muon Space)
UC Berkeley, PI Cynthia Gerlein-Safdi

## Explore the Data
Multiple datasets are being created under the auspices of the CYGNSS Science Team and specifically the Inundation Working Group. Here we show a comparison of two dates for a single variable from a single product, the surface water inundation fraction. We encourage users to explore the UCAR 3km Daily Dataset to look at different daily dates and to compare variables. Or, users may be interested in examining the UC Berkeley 1km Monthly Dataset.
