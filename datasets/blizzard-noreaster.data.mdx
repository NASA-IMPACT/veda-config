  ### About

  Nor’easters are perhaps the most notorious system that can bring blizzard conditions. Nor’easters frequent blizzard conditions to the I-95 corridor, can be either Miller Type A or B cyclones (but are more commonly Type B), and are often tracked using a coordinate benchmark known as the "40°N, 70°W rule." This location, just southeast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, serves as a critical reference point for meteorologists. If the center of a nor’easter passes near or over this benchmark as it moves to the northeast, it frequently results in significant snow and wind impacts for the densely populated I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston. This position aligns the storm to draw in cold Arctic air from the northwest while tapping into moist Atlantic air, creating the perfect setup for heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions.
