  ### About

  The Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) is a scale used to assess the societal impacts of major snowfall events across different regions in the United States. It accounts for snowfall amounts, the area affected, and population exposure to classify storms from Category 1 (Notable) to Category 5 (Extreme). Snowfall data for RSI calculations often come from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, which compiles reports from the National Weather Service (NWS), cooperative observers, and storm spotters. Additionally, automated observations from Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) provide real-time snowfall measurements at airports and other key locations, contributing to the overall dataset used to analyze storm severity and impact.
