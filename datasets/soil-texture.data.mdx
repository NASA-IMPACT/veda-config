    ### About
    The ISRIC Soil Texture dataset (SoilGrids 250) provides detailed soil texture classifications, which are critical for understanding soil properties, water retention, and agricultural potential. Maintained by the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC), this dataset has been instrumental in various environmental and agricultural studies across the globe. This classification system breaks soils down into different categories based on their percentage of sand, silt, and clay, providing an essential resource for researchers, land managers, and farmers.

    ### What the ISRIC Soil Texture Dataset Offers
    - Soil Texture Classes: This dataset classifies soils into twelve texture categories, ranging from sand, silt, and clay, to more complex combinations such as loam, clay loam, and silty clay. Each category offers a distinct combination of sand, silt, and clay content, helping users determine soil characteristics.
    
    - Soil Texture Triangle: A visualization tool used to depict the relationships between the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in soil. It allows users to easily locate and interpret soil types based on their texture composition.
    
    - Applications in Agriculture and Environmental Studies: The soil texture classification is pivotal in determining soil fertility, drainage capabilities, and erosion potential, making it crucial for land use planning, crop management, and climate studies.
