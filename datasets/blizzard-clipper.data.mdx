  ### About

  Alberta Clippers, Saskatchewan Screamers, and Manitoba Maulers are fast-moving low pressure systems that originate in the Canadian Prairies and bring cold, dry air and light to moderate snowfall to parts of the United States. These systems are named for their origins in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, respectively, and are distinguished by their speed and limited moisture content. Alberta Clippers are the most common of the three and typically travel southeastward across the northern Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes region, often bringing light amounts of snow, though localized areas can receive higher totals. Saskatchewan Screamers and Manitoba Maulers follow similar tracks but are less frequent. Due to their rapid movement, these storms rarely bring heavy snowfall, but their strong winds can create blowing snow and reduced visibility, occasionally leading to blizzard conditions. Additionally, they often usher in frigid Arctic air, leading to significant temperature drops that can be anomalous for impacted regions. These systems are a defining feature of winter weather across the northern United States and contribute heavily to the region's cold and snowy climatology, as in more active years handfuls of these systems can occur in quick succession.
