## Overview
Future changes to air temperature are expected to influence the phase of winter precipitation (snowfall or rainfall) and the timing and amount of snowmelt and streamflow. Here, we present the projected percent-change to Western US average winter temperature at quarter-degree spatial resoutions across 20-year time periods between 2016 and 2095. Projections are averaged from an ensemble of 23 downscaled climate models from the [CMIP6 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6).
