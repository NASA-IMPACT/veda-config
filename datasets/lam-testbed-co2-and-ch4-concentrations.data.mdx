    NIST is engaged in research to improve measurement of greenhouse gas emissions in areas containing multiple emission sources and sinks, such as cities. NIST's objective is to develop measurement tools supporting independent means to diagnose the accuracy of greenhouse gas inventory data at urban and regional geospatial scales. NIST has established [three test beds in U.S. cities](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds) to develop and evaluate the performance of advanced measurement capabilities for emissions independent of their origin. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Los Angeles air basin of California, and the U.S. Northeast corridor (beginning with the Baltimore/Washington D.C. region), the test beds have been selected for their varying meteorology, terrain and emissions characteristics. These test beds will serve as a means to independently diagnose the accuracy of emissions data obtained directly from emission or uptake sources.

    A variety of data are collected at the test bed locations including station measurements of various GHG and trace gas species, airborne observations, weather and surface fluxes, atmospheric profiling measurements including lidar measurements, and observations from rawinsondes. The interactive display below includes CO₂ and CH₄ concentration measurements from tower and rooftop sites within the Los Angeles Megacity test bed location. This concentration data provides important continuous measurements of GHGs in the atmospheric boundary layer which can be used, along with associated weather models, to reveal how GHG concentrations and, more importantly, urban emissions of GHGs change over space and time. While only tower and rooftop concentration data is shown in the GHG Center, the complete urban LAM test bed data collection can be accessed via NIST’s website: [https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds)

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Uncertainty estimates on each hourly observation are estimated using algorithms detailed in Karion et al., 2020 ([https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-699-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-699-2020)) and included in each data file.

    ## Scientific Details
    The Los Angeles Megacity Carbon Project (LA-MCP) was designed to demonstrate a scientifically robust measurement of multi-year emission trends for carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) in a large urban environment (a “megacity”) and to attribute such trends to emissions from various sectors. Determination of greenhouse gas fluxes and uncertainties in urban areas is critical for evaluating mitigation strategies. The current LA surface observation network includes eleven in situ analyzers situated on tower- or rooftop/building- based platforms for continuous measurements of CO₂, CH₄ and CO (not all species are measured at all sites, and only CO₂ and CH₄ data are displayed in the GHG Center). 

    Measurements are reported as dry air mole fractions on the NOAA/WMO X2007 (CO₂) and X2004A (CH₄) calibration scales, as reported by the WMO's CCL, NOAA/ESRL/GML. NOAA has recently released a new CO₂ scale, X2019. These data are reported on the X2007 scale. NIST plans to release all the data going back to 2015 under either a new version or an entirely separate release at a later date. 

    The data from the in-situ towers and rooftops are currently being used in both forward and inverse modeling frameworks and the inverse model results have been used to estimate carbon fluxes for Southern California. The Hestia project ([https://hestia.rc.nau.edu/About.html](https://hestia.rc.nau.edu/About.html)) has produced bottom-up inventory estimates of fossil carbon emissions for a total of five counties in the South Coast Air Basin, including Los Angeles, with high space/time resolution. The Hestia data product also provides information on sectorally-resolved fossil carbon emissions. 

    The LA Megacity project has also included flask sampling of ¹⁴CO₂ and other trace gases in the past.  In addition, the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS, [tmf.jpl.nasa.gov/clarsweather](https://tmf.jpl.nasa.gov/clarsweather/)) instrument on Mt. Wilson measures the slant column abundance of greenhouse gases by rastering across the LA basin roughly every 90 minutes. There have also been periodic aircraft sampling of greenhouse gases and meteorological conditions in the Los Angeles megacity during intensive campaigns.
