    ## About

    The annual median Leaf Area Index (LAI) maps of 2003 and 2021 were captured using combined Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 4 [dataset](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod15.php) (MCD15A3H Version 6.1). The actual dataset represents one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area at 500 meters spatial resolution and provides information at every 4 days. Annual median of the LAI datasets were calculated for both the years of 2003 and 2021 to illustrate the difference in vegetation cover.
