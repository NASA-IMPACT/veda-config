## Overview
  On August 8th, 2023, a devastating wildfire roared through the city of Lahaina, Hawai’i, located on the island of Maui and home to over 13,000 residents. This wildfire was reported sparked by a downed powerline on Lahainaluna Road, and though was initially put out was reinvigorated by intense wind gusts that prevailed throughout the day. The National Weather Service reported measured wind gusts as high as 67 mph in the area, which helped quickly spread the wildfire across much of Lahaina in the afternoon hours of August 8th.This dataset includes 3 layers supporting the Lahaina Fire.

  An experimental burned area index was then calculated from HLS imagery taken after the fire on August 13th, 2023. This index, known as BAIS2, highlighted the burned area quite well compared to the more traditional Normalized Burn Ratio Indices 1 and 2, and had the highest ‘probabilities’ of burned area over the severely scorched fields just uphill from the city.

  A three-band composite using the shortwave infrared, narrow near-infrared, and red bands (SWIR false color composite) of pre and post-fire HLS data reveals excellently the extent of the burned area from the Lahaina Fire. These scenes are taken from August 8 and 13, 2023.
