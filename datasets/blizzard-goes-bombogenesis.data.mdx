  ## About

  A defining feature of many nor’easters is bomb cyclogenesis, or **"bombogenesis"**, which occurs when a storm's central low pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, signifying rapid intensification of the system. The process is driven by the clash of cold air from the north and warm, humid air over the Atlantic. As the storm deepens, powerful winds spiral inward towards the central low pressure, enhancing snowfall rates and creating whiteout conditions. Bomb cyclogenesis often results in some of the most impactful nor’easters, which have been historically responsible for bringing record-breaking snowfall and hurricane-force winds to parts of the Northeast. The dataset is GOES satellite imagery of an example of a Noreaster undergoing bomb cyclogenesis off the East Coast of the USA on January 4, 2018. This TrueColor three-band composite satellite imagery is a combination of the red, green, and blue bands of GOES16 ABI. The green band was derived from the raw red, veggie, and blue bands.
