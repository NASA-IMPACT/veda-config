## Overview
The contiguous United States (CONUS) Disturbance Watcher system was built based on time-series analysis and machine learning techniques. The system consisted of two components. The first component, the retrospective disturbance analysis, extracted disturbance predictors from historical open access disturbance products and satellite datasets and built a series of machine learning models respectively for different lag stages. The second component, namely the near real-time monitoring, recursively updates per-pixel time-series models and outputted current vectors of disturbance predictor using Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD) algorithm, and then applied the offline machine learning models from the first component to map disturbance probabilities and patches. The system could be updated regularly in an interval of one week, or updated as an user-defined interval, such as one day that was used for Hurricane Ian monitoring. The per-day updating interval provided the quickest mapping response and the most extensive damage region as some would be recovered after days, while the highest computational resources were needed.   


**Scientific Details:**  
The Hurricane Ian disturbance probability layer shows the likelihood impacted by Hurricane Ian. The data came from the map production of [CONUS Disturbance Watcher system](https://gers.users.earthengine.app/view/nrt-conus) on Oct. 3th, 2022, when the first post-hurricane Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) 2.0 dataset on Sep. 30th, 2022 became available for downloading. The [HLS dataset](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/) produce harmonized surface reflectance products from four satellite sensors, i.e., Landsat-8, Landsat-9,  Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, providing observation once every 2-3 days. The probability layer (scaled by 100) describes the probability produced by machine learning models. The higher probability reveals the high spectral similarity to the historical disturbance.
