    The Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO₂ (ODIAC) data product is a monthly high-resolution global data product of modeled fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. A complex model incorporates and combines space-based nighttime light data and individual power plant emission/location profiles from the latest country fossil fuel CO₂ estimates (2000-2020) made by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) team at the Appalachian State University (CDIAC at AppState, Gilfillan et al. 2021, Hefner et al. 2022). The ODIAC estimated global spatial extent of fossil fuel CO₂ emissions is produced on a 1 km by 1 km grid that details variations in urban regions where emissions are most intense. The ODIAC CO₂ emission data is widely used by the international research community for applications such as CO₂ flux inversion, urban emission estimation, and observing system design experiments.  The ODIAC product was first created in 2009 by Dr. Tomohiro Oda with support from  the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) GOSAT project. The ODIAC team is now supported by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Carbon Monitoring System program, the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission and NIES. The US GHG Center displays the ODIAC 2024 version containing monthly data from January 2000 to December 2023 that replaces all previous versions.

    Tomohiro Oda, Shamil Maksyutov, (2015). ODIAC Fossil Fuel CO₂ Emissions Dataset (Version name: ODIAC2024), Center for Global Environmental Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies, [DOI:10.17595/20170411.001](http://doi.org/10.17595/20170411.001). (Reference date: 2025/06/10)

    ## Version History
    The current dataset version is v2024, which replaced the v2023 dataset in the US GHG Center in July 2025. Summary of dataset update:
    - The year 2024 version of ODIAC is based on the latest country fossil fuel CO₂ estimates (2000-2020) from the CDIAC team at the Appalachian State University, which includes an additional year of data compared to v2023. 
    - The year 2020 CDIAC country-level estimates were projected for the recent years (2021, 2022 and 2023) using fuel consumption data reported by the latest [2024 statistical review of world energy published by the Energy Institute](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review)

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Evaluating the accuracy and uncertainty of gridded emissions data is challenging because of the lack of direct physical measurements on grid scales. Proxies such as point source locations and satellite observations of nighttime lights are used to spatially estimate emissions to a grid rather than include actual measurements. The uncertainties associated with this approach for estimated emissions is unquantified at this time. Details about current limitations and caveats of the data can be found in Section 7 of [Oda, Maksyutov & Andres 2018](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/10/87/2018/essd-10-87-2018.pdf).

    ## Disclaimer
    This dataset has been transformed from its original format (GeoTIFF) into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) for display in the US GHG Center. Careful quality checks are used to ensure data transformation has been performed correctly. 
    
    ## Scientific Details
    The emission spatial disaggregation uses multiple spatial proxy data, such as geographical location of point sources, satellite observations of nightlights, and aircraft and ship fleet tracks.  The emissions seasonality was taken from the CDIAC monthly gridded data product (Andres et al. 2011) and the Carbon Monitor product (2020-2023, https://carbonmonitor.org/). The year 2020 CDIAC country-level estimates were projected for the recent years (2021, 2022 and 2023) using fuel consumption data reported by the latest [2024 statistical review of world energy published by the Energy Institute](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review). More details about the ODIAC approach, methodology, etc. are described in the [Oda et al. 2018 publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-87-2018).
