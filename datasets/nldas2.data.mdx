    **Temporal Extent:** Jan 2003 to Dec 2021 (January 1979 to present available from the NASA GES DISC)   
    **Temporal Resolution:** Monthly-averaged (Hourly data available from the NASA GES DISC)    
    **Spatial Extent:** CONUS (25 to 53 North and -125 to -67 West)  
    **Spatial Resolution:** 0.125° x 0.125°    
    **Data type:** Research <br />
    
    The precipitation from NLDAS-2 over CONUS is derived from a daily gridded precipitation analysis at 0.125-degrees from NOAA CPC.  The data is temporally disaggregated to hourly using a variety of data sources, primarily radar-estimated precipitation amounts from Doppler Stage II data.  Outside of CONUS, but still in the 25 to 53 North domain, different datasets are used to generate NLDAS-2 precipitation.  See https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/v2/forcing for details.
