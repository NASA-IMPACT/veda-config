Images of Earth at night give us an extraordinary view of human activity over time. The nighttime environment illuminates Earth features, including city infrastructure, lightning flashes, fishing boats navigating open water, gas flares, aurora, and natural hazards, such as lava flowing from an active volcano. Paired with the moonlight, researchers can also spot snow and ice, as well as other reflective surfaces that allow nighttime land and ocean analysis.

Researchers are using night light observations to support disaster response and recovery to identify regions most impacted by natural disasters or similar power outages.

## Scientific research
Nightlights data are collected by the [Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/viirs/) on the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) platform, a joint National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA satellite. The images are produced by [NASA’s Black Marble](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/) products suite. All data are calibrated daily, corrected, and validated with ground measurements for science-ready analysis.

Black Marble HD downscales radiances from the 500-meter product to street level using optical imagery from Landsat 8, a NASA and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) satellite, along with OpenStreetMap ancillary layers. This helps visualize impacted areas at the neighborhood scale to identify differences in recovery time across the regions.

## Interpreting the data
30-meter resolution Black Marble High Definition (HD) nighttime lights are visualized for New Orleans, LA and Puerto Rico to highlight the impacts and recovery from the landfalls of Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Maria respectively. For each natural disaster, there is a pre-, during-, and post-event image for baseline comparisons. Within the nightlights data layer, brighter areas indicate locations with higher light emissions. One limitation of nightlights data is the presence of cloud cover as clouds can reduce the surface brightness as observed by the satellite when conditions on the ground remain unchanged.
