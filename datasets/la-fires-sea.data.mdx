  ### About

  The Significant Ecological Areas (SEAs) and Coastal Resource Areas (CRAs) dataset identifies ecologically valuable and environmentally sensitive regions in Los Angeles County. These areas are designated based on biodiversity, habitat connectivity, and ecological function. SEAs support native plant and animal species, while CRAs include coastal habitats vital for marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
