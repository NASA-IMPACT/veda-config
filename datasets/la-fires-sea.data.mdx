  ### About

  The Significant Ecological Areas (SEAs) and Coastal Resource Areas (CRAs) dataset identifies ecologically valuable and environmentally sensitive regions in Los Angeles County. These areas are designated based on biodiversity, habitat connectivity, and ecological function. SEAs support native plant and animal species, while CRAs include coastal habitats vital for marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

  ### What This Data Offers

  * Biodiversity Protection: SEAs highlight areas critical for wildlife, native vegetation, and ecosystem services.
  * Coastal Resource Management: CRAs include coastal wetlands, dunes, and estuaries, providing resilience against sea-level rise and erosion.
  * Land Use Planning & Conservation: Supports environmental protection policies and planning efforts in Los Angeles County.
  * Wildfire Risk and Recovery Analysis: Helps assess how ecological areas are impacted by fire and guides post-fire restoration efforts.
