    The Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network (GGGRN) for the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) Group is part of NOAA'S Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) in Boulder, CO. The Reference Network measures the atmospheric distribution and trends of the three main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and many other trace gases which help interpretation of the main GHGs. The Reference Network measurement program includes continuous in-situ measurements at 4 baseline observatories (global background sites) and 8 tall towers, as well as flask-air samples collected by volunteers at over 50 additional regional background sites and from small aircraft conducting regular vertical profiles. The air samples are returned to GML for analysis where measurements of about 55 trace gases are done. NOAA's GGGRN maintains the World Meteorological Organization international calibration scales for CO₂, CH₄, CO, N<sub>2</sub>O, and SF<sub>6</sub> in air. The measurements from the GGGRN serve as a comparison with measurements made by many other international laboratories, and with regional studies. They are widely used in modeling studies that infer space-time patterns of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases that are optimally consistent with the atmospheric observations, given wind patterns. These data serve as an early warning for climate "surprises". The measurements are also helpful for the ongoing evaluation of remote sensing technologies.

    For more information refer to the [dataset documentation](https://gml.noaa.gov/aftp/data/greenhouse_gases/co2/flask/surface/README_co2_surface-flask_ccgg.html) and [sampling location information](https://gml.noaa.gov/dv/site/?program=ccgg).

    - **Temporal Extent:** 1968 - 2022, varies by station   
    - **Temporal Resolution:** Varies by station, can be daily up to weekly
    - **Spatial Extent:** United States   
    - **Spatial Resolution:** Point location samples    
    - **Data Units:**  parts CO₂ per million (ppm)
    - **Data Type:** Operational
    - **Data Latency:** Updated annually

    **Scientific Details:** CO₂ measurements are formally reported in mole fraction units of micromol (10<sup>-6</sup> mole) of CO₂ per mol of dry air.  However, for communicating with broader audiences we refer to mole fraction as “concentration” in units of parts per million (ppm). This CO₂ data set provides CO₂ dry air mole fractions from more than 80 NOAA GML GGGRN sites across the globe. Measurements have been made using a highly-calibrated nondispersive infrared absorption analyzer (NDIR, before August 2019) or a cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS, since August 2019).

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Measurements are reported on the WMO X2019 CO₂ mole fraction scale. More information on this scale is available at https://gml.noaa.gov/ccl/co2_scale.html.  Accuracy is approximately 0.1 ppm.  For details, see
