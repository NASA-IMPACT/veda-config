    The Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network (GGGRN) for the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) Group is part of NOAA'S Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) in Boulder, CO. The Reference Network measures the atmospheric distribution and trends of the three main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and many other trace gases which help interpretation of the main GHGs. The Reference Network measurement program includes continuous in-situ measurements at 4 baseline observatories (global background sites) and 8 tall towers, as well as flask-air samples collected by volunteers at over 50 additional regional background sites and from small aircraft conducting regular vertical profiles. The flask air samples are returned to GML for analysis where measurements of about 55 trace gases are completed.

    This dataset contains CO₂ concentration measurements in units of parts per million (ppm) made from surface in-situ and tower sites and from surface flask air samples. The surface in-situ and tower instrumentation measures CO₂ continuously (hourly) while the flask air samples are non-continuous measurements (frequency varies by station). Due to the high data volume of hourly tower measurements, daily and monthly averages are generated for display in the US GHG Center. Data shown for all stations are quality controlled and are available on the GHG Center 6 - 7 months after the previous year. One station atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii also has near real-time (NRT) data available. NRT data is not yet quality controlled and is replaced by the quality-controlled data once available. The Mauna Loa station measurements were suspended from November 29, 2022 to July 4, 2023 due to volcanic eruptions near the station. To maintain the long-term record, a station was placed atop Mauna Kea (21 miles to the northeast) and measurements from the Mauna Kea observatory are substituted during this time to fill in the Mauna Loa record. The Mauna Kea quality-controlled measurements are noted using coral color. The Mauna Kea observations are in very good agreement with the Mauna Loa record.

    NOAA's GGGRN maintains the World Meteorological Organization international calibration scales for CO₂, CH₄, CO, N<sub>2</sub>O, and SF<sub>6</sub> in air. The measurements from the GGGRN serve as a comparison with measurements made by many other international laboratories, and with regional studies. They are widely used in modeling studies that infer space-time patterns of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases that are optimally consistent with the atmospheric observations, given wind patterns. These data serve as an early warning for climate "surprises". The measurements are also helpful for the ongoing evaluation of remote sensing technologies.

    ## Dataset Accuracy
    Measurements are reported on the WMO X2019 CO₂ mole fraction scale. More information on this scale is available at https://gml.noaa.gov/ccl/co2_scale.html.  Accuracy is approximately 0.1 ppm.  For details, see

    ## Disclaimer
    Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise measurements possible. However, NOAA reserves the right to make corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified. NOAA is not responsible for results and conclusions based on use of these data without regard to this warning.
    
    Due to the high data volume of tower measurements which occur hourly, tower measurements have been aggregated into daily and monthly averages for display in the US GHG Center. Hourly data are [available from NOAA](https://gml.noaa.gov/aftp/data/greenhouse_gases/co2/in-situ/tower/).

    Due to shortness of record or complexity of interpretation, the following surface PFP flask sites have been excluded:
    LAC, INX, BWD, NEB, NWB, TMD, SPF, KLM, MKO, MLO, HFM

    ## Scientific Details
    CO₂ measurements are formally reported in mole fraction units of micromol (10<sup>-6</sup> mole) of CO₂ per mol of dry air.  However, for communicating with broader audiences we refer to mole fraction as “concentration” in units of parts per million (ppm). This CO₂ data set provides CO₂ dry air mole fractions from more than 80 NOAA GML GGGRN sites across the globe. Measurements have been made using a highly-calibrated nondispersive infrared absorption analyzer (NDIR, before August 2019) or a cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS, since August 2019).
