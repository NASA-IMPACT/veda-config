    ### About

    Blizzard Alley is a term used to describe a region in the north-central United States, particularly the eastern Dakotas, western Minnesota, and parts of Nebraska and Iowa, that experiences blizzards regularly. This region is among the most blizzard-prone areas in North America. This specific dataset shows the Blizzard Alley region as interpolated from the National Centers for Environmental Information's (NCEI's) Storm Events Database. The Storm Events Database contains reports of officially confirmed blizzard conditions across the United States, beginning in 1950.
