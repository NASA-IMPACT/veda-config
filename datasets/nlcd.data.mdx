  ### About

  The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) stands as a paramount dataset offering an in-depth overview of the land cover characteristics in the United States. Spearheaded by the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, this database is renewed every two to three years to provide updated and accurate data for the nation.

  This is a collective effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC, composed of various federal agencies, has a rich legacy spanning over 30 years of generating consistent and pertinent land cover information on a national scale. The NLCD is a testament to their dedication and has emerged as one of the most frequently utilized geospatial datasets within the U.S., catering to an extensive audience ranging from scientists, land managers, city planners, to students.

  As of its latest release, the NLCD showcases land cover data and related changes across nine specific epochs, starting from 2001 and culminating in 2021. These datasets are meticulously crafted, ensuring continuity and consistency with the past releases (from 2001-2019). This methodological consistency ensures that the datasets from the different epochs are directly comparable and well-suited for mult-temporal analyses.

  ### What NLCD Offers

  * Land Cover: This product details the land cover of the Conterminous U.S. at a 30-meter spatial resolution, employing a 16-class legend rooted in the modified Anderson Level II classification system.

  * Land Cover Change Index: This visualization tool portrays the transformations that have transpired across all the NLCD epochs, furnishing users with a holistic view of the evolving landscape.

  * Urban Imperviousness: A crucial dataset for urbanization studies, it highlights impervious surfaces in urban regions, showcasing them as a percentage of the developed surface at every 30-meter pixel.

  * Urban Impervious Descriptor: A more nuanced product that classifies specific urban developments, such as roads, wind tower sites, building locations, and energy production sites. This aids in a more granular analysis of urban features.
