  ### About

  The Doppler on Wheels (DOW) is a mobile radar system that provides high-resolution, ground-based data for severe weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, and other extreme meteorological phenomena. The data from DOW7 offers detailed, real-time insights into storm structure and evolution, supporting research, forecasting improvements, and in-depth analysis of atmospheric dynamics. Operated by the Center for Severe Weather Research, DOW data is instrumental in providing accurate measurements of wind velocities, precipitation patterns, and radar reflectivity, all with an unmatched level of mobility and precision.


  This dataset provides valuable insights into tornado formation, storm lifecycle analysis, and tornado vortex structure evolution by offering detailed radar observations from mobile platforms positioned directly in the storm's path. Such data enhances scientific understanding of storm dynamics and supports both operational and research-driven forecasting improvements.
