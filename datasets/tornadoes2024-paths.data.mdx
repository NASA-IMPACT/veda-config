  ### About

  The National Weather Service’s (NWS) Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT) is a pivotal geographic information system (GIS)-hosted dataset designed to support post-storm damage surveys conducted by meteorologists. This toolkit plays a crucial role in documenting and analyzing tornado and significant straight-line wind damage across affected areas. Ground-based surveys are carried out to capture this information, which is then geospatially referenced and uploaded to the DAT database. 

  This dataset encompasses comprehensive elements such as tornado track centerlines, polygons depicting Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale ratings along tornado paths, and detailed descriptions with meteorological statistics for each logged damage location. In some cases, it also includes imagery collected by survey teams, adding further context to damage assessments. The comprehensive information in this dataset makes it invaluable for researchers, planners, and emergency responders.

  ### What the DAT Offers

  * Tornado Track Centerlines: Geospatial data capturing the precise paths of tornadoes, providing insights into their trajectory and extent.

  * Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale Polygons: Detailed polygons of the EF rating at each location along a tornado’s path, offering a better understanding of the severity of the storm across different points.
  
  * Location-Specific Damage Descriptions: Comprehensive descriptions of damage at each surveyed point, paired with relevant meteorological statistics to offer deeper insight into storm impacts.
    
  * Damage Imagery: When available, surveyor-captured images provide visual context to logged damage points, further enhancing data interpretation and analysis.
