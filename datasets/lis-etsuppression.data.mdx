    Change in ET for 2020 fires using model outputs from Land Information System (LIS) framework that synthesizes multiple remote sensing observations within the Noah-MP land surface model. Change is calculated as the difference of ET in the immediate post-fire water year from that in the immediate pre-fire water year. The difference is normalized by pre-fire ET and negative values denote vegetation disturbance induced by fire or by a climatological anomaly resulting in the decline in ET.

  	Change in ET for 2020 fires using model outputs from Land Information System (LIS) framework that synthesizes multiple remote sensing observations within the Noah-MP land surface model. Change is calculated as the difference of ET in the immediate post-fire water year from that in the immediate pre-fire water year. The difference is normalized by pre-fire ET and negative values denote vegetation disturbance induced by fire or by a climatological anomaly resulting in the decline in ET.
