    Future changes to air temperature are expected to influence the phase of winter precipitation (snowfall or rainfall) and the timing and amount of snowmelt and streamflow, while changes to precipitation are expected to alter the volume and timing of snow water resources. Here, we present the projected percent-change to Western US air tempeature and cumulative winter precipitation at quarter-degree spatial resoutions across 20-year time periods between 2016 and 2095. Projections are averaged from an ensemble of 23 downscaled climate models from the CMIP6 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections.

  ## About
  Future changes to air temperature are expected to influence the phase of winter precipitation (snowfall or rainfall) and the timing and amount of snowmelt and streamflow. Future changes to precipitation are expected to alter the volume and timing of snow water resources. Here, we present the projected percent-change to Western US air temperature and cumulative winter precipitation at quarter-degree spatial resoutions across 20-year time periods between 2016 and 2085. Projections are averaged from an ensemble of 23 downscaled climate models from the [CMIP6 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6).

  We have examined two different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) which describe potential future scenarios based on decisions in climate policies and actions as well as human infrastructure and governance. We have gathered the SSP2-4.5 which represents an intermediate radiative forcing pathway and the SSP5-8.5 representing a future with a high radiative forcing.
