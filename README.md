# Welcome to Delta

Delta is a dashboard to explore data.

Delta is organized around the concept of Thematic areas. Each thematic area explores a topic in detail via datasets and discoveries.  
A Dataset represents a piece of geo-referenced data displayed as a set of related layers on a map.  
Discoveries are long form pieces of content that tell a story about some interesting portion of the data.

## Getting started

2) Check [CONFIGURATION](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md) to see a list of configuration options for Delta.
3) Check [CONTENT](./docs/CONTENT.md) for how to structure the content pieces.
