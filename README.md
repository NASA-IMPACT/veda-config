# Welcome to Veda

Veda is a dashboard to explore data.

Veda is organized around the concept of Thematic areas. Each thematic area explores a topic in detail via datasets and discoveries.  
A Dataset represents a piece of geo-referenced data displayed as a set of related layers on a map.  
Discoveries are long form pieces of content that tell a story about some interesting portion of the data.
