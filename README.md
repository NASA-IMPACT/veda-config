# Welcome to the GHG dashboard

This dashboard is organized around datasets and stories.
A Dataset represents a piece of geo-referenced data displayed as a set of related layers on a map.  
Stories are long form pieces of content that tell a story about some interesting portion of the data.

## Getting started

1) Check [SETUP](./docs/SETUP.md) to see how you can run the project locally. (You'll need this to preview content.)
2) Alternatively, you can run the project using Github Codespaces. Check the [Codespaces guide](./docs/GH_CODESPACES.md) to know how.

If you plan to do development on `veda-config-ghg` or update the `veda-ui`Â version check [DEVELOPMENT](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Creating content and configuring this dashboard

The configuration and content options for this dashboard will depend on the `veda-ui` (the actual interface code) version that `veda-config-ghg` is running.

**The documentation for the current version can be viewed at [v2.0.0 of veda-ui](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui/blob/v2.0.0/README.md).
