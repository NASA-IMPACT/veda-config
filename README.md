​VEDA is a dashboard to explore data.

VEDA is organized around datasets and discoveries.
A Dataset represents a piece of geo-referenced data displayed as a set of related layers on a map.  
Discoveries are long form pieces of content that tell a story about some interesting portion of the data.

## Getting started

1) Check [SETUP](./docs/SETUP.md) to see how you can run the project locally. (You'll need this to preview content.)
2) Check [CONFIGURATION](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md) to see a list of configuration options for VEDA.
3) Check [CONTENT](./docs/CONTENT.md) for how to structure the content pieces.

If you plan to add features to `veda-config` check [DEVELOPMENT](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
