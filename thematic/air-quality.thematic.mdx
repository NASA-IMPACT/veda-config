**Traffic, wildfires, and power plants** all emit air pollutants and greenhouse gasses as a product of combustion. Humans have known for more than a century that burning fossil fuels and other materials generates smoke that contains a mixture of potentially hazardous particles and trace gasses. Breathing air with a high concentration of gasses from combustion can irritate airways in the human respiratory system and contribute to respiratory diseases and other health problems.
Using long-term global observations from satellites and ground-based instruments, scientists have kept a watchful eye on several gasses emitted by combustion for more than a decade.  These Earth observations help predict and track the pollutants that affect human health and contribute to global climate change.

**NASA scientists are leading much of this research** and share stories here that show how data from satellites are used to enhance the scientific understanding of combustion-related trace gasses. Several of these combustion-related gasses negatively impact human health and some contribute to global climate change. The data also provide fundamental information for improving climate change prediction and investigating solutions to reduce air pollution in major cities around the world.

**Data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)** show atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) levels for various regions in the United States, India, and China. This instrument has been tracking the annual average abundance of these gasses since 2005. These charts highlight different trends in these combustion gasses; in some countries the levels of these gasses have decreased dramatically, while other countries show a long-term increase. 
In the eastern US, for example, both NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> levels decreased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over the Ohio River valley and western Pennsylvania fell by 80%, and NO<sub>2</sub> levels in the region fell by more than 40%, in response to clean air legislation.

The annual OMI data can be explored to generate maps and trends in these two combustion-related gasses at both the regional and city scales. Click here to learn more about this research.
