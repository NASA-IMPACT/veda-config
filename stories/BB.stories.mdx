    The Black Belt region of Alabama is a significant area both historically and socioeconomically. It derives its name not from race, but from the rich, dark, fertile soil that characterizes the area. However, over time, "Black Belt" has also come to reference the predominantly African American population that has historically resided in the region.

    The disparities in environmental burdens stem from practices such as freeway construction, redlining, and other forms of discrimination that have marginalized communities of color, displacing them from their support networks and clustering them in neighborhoods lacking resources but rife with health hazards. Initiated by the federally sponsored Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s, these maps categorized neighborhoods into four grades based on security for emergency home lending: A (most desirable), B (still desirable), C (declining), and D (hazardous, i.e., redlined). Racial redlining effectively marked Black and brown neighborhoods as risky and unsuitable for loans, depriving them of essential infrastructure such as sewer and water systems [6]. Despite the Fair Housing Act banning racial discrimination in housing in 1968, the legacy of explicit racial discrimination persists, shaping patterns of racial residential segregation today.  For instance, redlining, a historically discriminatory federal mortgage appraisal policy from the 1930s, continues to correlate with present-day air pollution disparities across 202 U.S. cities [7]. In neighborhoods graded D, the majority (>50%) of the population comprises people of color (POC), and in 74% of these neighborhoods, the median income is low to moderate. Redlining designations correlate with various exposures, including greenspace prevalence, tree canopy coverage, urban-heat exposure disparities, and long-term health effects such as asthma, cancer, adverse birth outcomes, and overall urban health.

    Landfills are created for responsible waste disposal, and operate under federal regulations. While hazardous waste is federally regulated, individual states are responsible for establishing requirements for how non-hazardous landfills operate and for monitoring compliance. Despite these regulations, they contribute to air and water pollution, with toxic substances seeping into groundwater. Environmental impacts of landfills include air pollution, aesthetic degradation, soil contamination, and water quality reduction, as well as unintended hosting of wildlife. Additionally, landfills generate significant noise pollution from heavy machinery and truck traffic, which further diminishes property values. Heavy truck [traffic noise](https://ceds.org/traffic/#:~:text=Heavy%20truck%20traffic%20lowers%20property,a%20level%20of%2050%20dBA/) lowers property value by 30 to 50 times more than car traffic, as trucks emit noise levels 16 times louder than cars from a distance of 50 feet.

    Methane, a byproduct of decomposing organic matter, is a significant contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Landfills are one of the top three contributors to methane emissions in the USA. Despite constituting only a fraction of total human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, methane possesses significant heat-trapping capacity, approximately 80 times greater per pound than carbon dioxide. Consequently, reductions in methane emissions yield a more immediate impact on global warming. The gas is odorless and colorless, making leaks extremely difficult to detect, thus requiring the addition of mercaptan to natural gas for leak detection in homes to avoid explosion risk. Continuous exposure to very high concentrations of methane can lead to adverse health effects, including loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, and even fatality. Thus, identifying specific methane emission sources is a critical step in addressing its impacts. By pinpointing major emitters of methane plumes, decision makers can swiftly take action to mitigate emissions.

    ## Dallas

    Dallas is the largest metropolitan area in Texas and the fourth largest in the United States. The Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metro has experienced a consistent increased rate in population growth and diversity. According to 2023 census data, [Dallas’s](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/) 1,299,544 residents are 42.2% Hispanic, 3.7% Asian, 28.3% non-Hispanic white, and 23.6% black.
