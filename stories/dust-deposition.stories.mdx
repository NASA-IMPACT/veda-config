    ## Introduction
    The Earth system is large and complicated, involving many interconnected parts of the land, ocean, and atmosphere. They all influence one another in different ways and impact many disciplines across Earth science. These effects are not limited to the Earth system, but potentially extend to the greater global economy. One primary example of this is phytoplankton. This tiny, but mighty organism is one of the most important organisms in the ocean. Fish and other marine organisms typically feed on phytoplankton, making them the first step of energy in the food chain and the foundation for marine ecosystems around the globe. This makes understanding how phytoplankton react to various conditions, including dust deposition and meteorological factors, vitally important. The Tropical Northern Atlantic Ocean (TNAO) is an ocean basin that can be observed to analyze these effects. Dust plumes in this region typically begin in the Saharan Desert in Northern Africa and are frequently carried across the Atlantic Ocean.

    ## Meteorological Variables in Analyzing Phytoplankton

    The different meteorological variables that may impact and affect phytoplankton across the TNAO include: 

    <li>**Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD):** A measure of how much sunlight is blocked or scattered by aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere)</li>
    <li>**Cloud Cover:** Fraction or percentage of the sky covered by clouds</li>
    <li>**Sea-Surface Temperatures (SST):** The temperature at the top layer of the ocean</li>
    <li>**Wind Speed:** The rate at which the wind is moving on the ocean surface</li>
    <li>**Dust Concentration:** The amount of dust present in a volume of the atmosphere</li>

    Satellite data, specifically from NASA’s **P**lankton, **A**erosol, **C**loud, and ocean **E**cosystem (**PACE**) satellite, plays a massive role when it comes to analyzing dust and its effects on phytoplankton. Additionally, NASA’s **M**odern **E**ra **R**etrospective analysis for **R**esearch and **A**pplications Version **2** (**MERRA-2**) was heavily used as a source of historical weather data, and products from the **MOD**erate resolution **I**maging **S**pectroradiometer (**MODIS**) - a satellite-based Earth observation sensor - were used as a means to obtain observations of different variables on the Earth’s surface.

    These variables were studied using data from the different NASA data products. AOD and cloud cover were mainly measured using Terra and Aqua satellites. SST were also obtained using MODIS. Wind Speed and dust concentration were analyzed using MERRA-2 data. Lastly, chlorophyll-a used PACE satellite data for analysis.

    PACE and MODIS data shows that chlorophyll-a concentrations are increasing across the TNAO over the previous decade (Figure 1; Map 1). Chlorophyll-a concentration is a reasonable approximation for phytoplankton because similar to plants, phytoplankton undergo photosynthesis to convert sunlight into oxygen.

    This data suggests that there is an increase in phytoplankton, as chlorophyll-a concentrations have been steadily increasing. The observed increase in phytoplankton compared to previous years suggests a potential meteorological influence that warrants further investigation.

    ## AOD and Chlorophyll-a

    There is a slight increasing trend in AOD over time, based on statistical analysis across the TNAO (Figure 2). This rise in dust leads to more sunlight being scattered or absorbed, which reduces the amount of light reaching the ocean surface. 

    This trend would seem to imply that the more dust deposition there is, the more abundant the phytoplankton are. However, when comparing AOD directly to chlorophyll-a, a negative trend is revealed, suggesting that dust alone cannot be the sole cause of increasing phytoplankton concentrations across the TNAO. 
  </Prose>
</Block>


<Block>
  <Prose>
    ## Cloud Cover and Chlorophyll-a

    One notable observation is that the phytoplankton population has flourished in recent years, despite an overall increase in cloud cover (Figure 3). Typically, increased cloudiness reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the ocean surface, thus limiting photosynthesis. However, chlorophyll-a concentrations have continued to rise, suggesting that cloud cover alone is not a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth.

    Looking more closely at cloud cover, there is a positive trend observed across the TNAO when examining MERRA-2-derived monthly mean values. While clouds can reduce light availability, rainfall—which can frequently accompany increased cloudiness—shows a decreasing trend in this region. Rainfall can negatively affect phytoplankton by washing atmospheric dust (a key nutrient source) out of the air. Therefore, the decline in rainfall may be contributing to more favorable conditions for phytoplankton, helping to explain the observed rise in chlorophyll-a concentrations, despite increased cloud cover.

  <Prose>
    ## SST and Chlorophyll-a

    There is a slightly positive trend in SSTs over time in the TNAO (Figure 4). This would suggest a slight reduction of phytoplankton as decreasing SSTs are typically a sign of increased mixing and upwelling. This allows nutrients located deeper in the ocean to mix towards the surface, giving phytoplankton easier access.

    However, when taking a look at how phytoplankton responds to this increasing trend, the opposite effect occurs. Chlorophyll-a concentrations show an increasing trend as SST increases. This would suggest that SSTs likely don't play a significant role in increasing phytoplankton production in the TNAO.
  </Prose>
</Block>

<Block>
  <Prose>
    ## Wind Speed and Chlorophyll-a

    Wind speed is also a factor that heavily influences nutrient mixing, similar to the effects of SST trends. Higher wind speeds would promote stronger mixing of the nutrients that the phytoplankton are able to use. Based on trends associated with MERRA-2-derived monthly mean values, wind speeds have slightly decreased across the TNAO (Figure 5). 

    However, the effect of wind speed on phytoplankton is consistent with the previously discussed rationale of upwelling nutrients for phytoplankton. This indicates that when winds are relatively strong, mixing processes can still occur.

    ## Dust Concentration and Chlorophyll-a

    Higher concentrations of Saharan dust are being transported and deposited across the surface of the Atlantic Ocean over the time period examined (Figure 6). This variable has a positive influence on chlorophyll-a levels, indicating that phytoplankton are responding to increased dust deposition across the surface of the TNAO.

    ## Conclusion
    NASA Earth observation data products revealed that phytoplankton growth across the TNAO is primarily associated with decreasing trends in rainfall and increasing concentrations of dust deposition on the ocean surface. These environmental conditions provide an abundant supply of crucial nutrients to the phytoplankton from incoming dust plumes, allowing them to flourish. Ultimately, sustainability practices of phytoplankton populations are essential to the neighboring coastal communities within this region, including Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Fisheries are a dominant part of these countries’ food supply, economy, and overall, livelihood. Specifically, the fishing industries of  these West African countries make up as much as 30% of national revenue. This includes the exportation of fish around the world, making up a several billion dollar industry. In 2008, exports to the European Union alone made up about $1.75 billion in revenue to West Africa. More recently, the United States imported nearly [$30 million](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName%3DFisheries%2Band%2BAquaculture%2Bin%2BSenegal_Dakar_Senegal_SG2022-0015.pdf%26utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1750872771310161&usg=AOvVaw1QZHzFBra_Phxf1ljPJH0r) worth of tuna, mollusks, octopus, and shrimp from Senegal during 2019.  As phytoplankton productivity increases across the TNAO, so does marine biodiversity, which in turn supports the sustainable livelihoods of West African communities that depend on marine resources.
