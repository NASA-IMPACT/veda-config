    ## Introduction
    The Earth system is large and complicated, involving many interconnected parts of the land, ocean, and atmosphere. They all influence one another in different ways and impact many disciplines across Earth science. These effects are not limited to the Earth system, but potentially extend to the greater global economy. One primary example of this is phytoplankton. This tiny, but mighty organism is one of the most important organisms in the ocean. Fish and other marine organisms typically feed on phytoplankton, making them the first step of energy in the food chain and the foundation for marine ecosystems around the globe. This makes understanding how phytoplankton react to various conditions,  including dust deposition and meteorological factors, vitally important. The Tropical Northern Atlantic Ocean (TNAO) is an ocean basin that can be observed to analyze these effects. Dust plumes in this region typically begin in the Saharan Desert, in Northern Africa, and frequently gets carried across the Atlantic Ocean.

      ## Meteorological Variables in Analyzing Phytoplankton
    </Prose>

    <Prose>
      The different meteorological variables that may impact and affect phytoplankton across the TNAO include: 
    </Prose> 
    <ul>
      <li>Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD): A measure of how much sunlight is blocked or scattered by aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere)</li>
      <li>Cloud Cover: Fraction or percentage of the sky covered by clouds</li>
      <li>Sea-Surface Temperatures (SST): The temperature at the top layer of the ocean</li>
      <li>Wind Speed: The rate at which the wind is moving on the ocean surface</li>
      <li>Dust Concentration: The amount of dust present in a volume of the atmosphere</li>
    </ul>


  <Prose> 
    <p> Satellite data, specifically from NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite, plays a massive role when it comes to analyzing dust and its effects on phytoplankton. Additionally, NASA’s Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) was heavily used as a source of historical weather data, and products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - a satellite-based Earth observation sensor - were used as a means to obtain observations of different variables on the Earth’s surface. </p>
    <p> These variables were studied using data from the different NASA data products. AOD and cloud cover were mainly measured using Terra and Aqua satellites. SST were also obtained using MODIS. Wind Speed and dust concentration were analyzed using MERRA-2 data. Lastly, chlorophyll-a used PACE satellite data for analysis. </p>
    <p> PACE data shows that chlorophyll-a concentrations are increasing across the TNAO over the previous decade (Figure 1). Chlorophyll-a concentration is a reasonable approximation for phytoplankton because similar to plants, phytoplankton undergo photosynthesis to convert sunlight into oxygen. </p>

    This data suggests that there is an increase in phytoplankton, as chlorophyll-a concentrations have been steadily increasing. The observed increase in phytoplankton compared to previous years suggests a potential meteorological influence that warrants further investigation.

    ## Conclusion
    With utilizing MODIS, PACE, and MERRA-2 data, we are able to analyze the effects caused by different meteorological variables onto phytoplankton across the TNAO. By reviewing these variables, we can better understand exactly how phytoplankton reacts to each one of these variables over time. The analyzed data suggests that the primary drivers of phytoplankton growth across the TNAO are largely due to a decrease in rainfall and an increase in dust deposition over the open ocean. In essence, nutrients would be supplied to the phytoplankton and continue to grow in population, since rainfall wouldn’t wash out as many nutrients from the incoming dust plumes. This wouldn’t assume that other variables such SST, AOD, and wind speed couldn’t have impacts, rather their influence less comparatively. With increasing phytoplankton populations across the TNAO, it would likely bring an increase in marine biodiversity, with many oceanside communities around the Atlantic Ocean relying on fishing as a dominant part of their economies.
