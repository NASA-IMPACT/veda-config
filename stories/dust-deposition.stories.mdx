    ## Introduction
    Phytoplankton are marine organisms that contain chlorophyll and utilize photosynthesis to grow. During photosynthesis, phytoplankton use sunlight as an energy source to produce biomass from dissolved atmospheric carbon dioxide and nutrients present in the ocean. Thus phytoplankton plays an important role as it removes carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. In addition, phytoplankton is consumed by marine animals and therefore is crucial for maintaining a healthy oceanic food chain. 

    Phytoplankton are one of the most important organisms to inhabit the planet. Spcifically, they are part of the larger marine ecosystem around the entire globe. They typically make up the bottom of the foodchain for most marine food webs. When dust is deposited onto the sea-surface, it can help foster increased growth among phytoplankton species. Since different regions of the world have different soures of dust

    ## Satellite Analysis of Dust Deposition

    We used a multi-decadal collection of NASA MODIS satellite sensor estimates of ocean chlorophyll, clouds and output from the NASA MERRA model to examine changes in phytoplankton growth over the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) region (36W, 6N, 27W, 15N). We used monthly averaged MODIS sensor retrievals of chlorophyll concentration at the ocean surface over the TNA region to examine trends of phytoplankton growth. Monthly averaged time series of chlorophyll concentrations show an increasing trend of phytoplankton over the TNA region (Figure 1).

    including the amount of sunlight, nutrient availability, sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidity. Cloud cover and aerosols in the atmosphere both block sunlight and thus affect the ocean chlorophyll amount. Studies show that when the amount of sunlight is reduced by clouds, the deeper layers of the ocean are most affected and thus plankton growth is concentrated at the surface and can lead to an increase in chlorophyll near the ocean surface. Nutrient availability can be affected by atmospheric aerosols, especially dust which can directly fall into the ocean or may get washed out by rain into the ocean. However, when rain washes out dust from the atmosphere, it can also bring other particles and soluble gases present in the atmosphere which can affect ocean acidity. Sea surface temperature influence on chlorophyll is complex, with chlorophyll concentration increasing with SST in some regions of the globe and vice versa in other regions.

     We used datasets for cloud cover, direct deposition and rain washout of dust, sea surface temperature and rain generated by the NASA Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA2) dataset to examine which factors are important for explaining increasing chlorophyll trends over TNA. Our statistical modeling shows that cloud cover, direct dust fallout and SST all have a positive influence on chlorophyll concentrations in the TNA region. However, rain and dust washed out by rain on to ocean, both have a negative influence. While increases in cloud cover and SST will cause chlorophyll concentration to increase, monthly average time series over the TNA region obtained from NASA MERRA show no increasing trend during 2015-2023 (Figure 2 and 3). However, the time series of direct dust fallout obtained from NASA MERRA shows an increasing trend during the same time period (Figure 4). Both rain and rain washout of dust show a decreasing trend during the 2015-2023 time period. This implies that the detrimental effect of rain on plankton growth is reduced during this time period. Thus our analysis shows that increasing chlorophyll and plankton growth is driven by increasing dust deposits and decreasing rainfall in the TNA region.

    ## Conclusion
    Implications of our analysis are that the changes in climate occurring over the TNA region and the Sahel are leading to an increase in plankton growth in the TNA region. This in turn leads to the added removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse and the major driver of human-induced climate change.
