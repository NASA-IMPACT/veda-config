    ## Introduction
    The Earth system is a vast and complex system that involves many interconnected parts from land, ocean, and atmosphere. They all influence one another in different ways that impacts many disciplines across earth sciences. These effects don’t just impact the Earth-system, but potentially the greater global economy. One such example of this is phytoplankton. This tiny, but mighty organism is considered to be one of the most important organisms in the ocean. This is largely due to its influence on the carbon cycle and the larger marine ecosystem around the globe. Fish and other marine organisms typically feed on phytoplankton. This makes understanding how phytoplankton react to different conditions, such as dust deposition and other factors vitally important. This, in turn, can affect the larger global fish market, economically. This means several billions of dollars can be affected depending on meteorological factors that can influence phytoplankton. There are many different oceanic basins that can be observed for such phenomena. However, this work will focus specifically on the Tropical Northern Atlantic Ocean (TNAO) and analyzing its effects on the phytoplankton there. Dust plumes like the one shown in video 1 are very common across the TNAO and are very easily tracked.

    Dust is important, though other meteorological variables may have important effects as well.

    ## Meteorological Variables in Analyzing Phytoplankton
    
    This work analyzes different meteorological variables that may impact and affect phytoplankton across the TNAO. These variables include: 
      <ul>
        <ls>Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD): A measure of how much sunlight is blocked or scattered by aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere)</ls>
        <ls>Cloud Cover: Fraction or percentage of the sky covered by clouds</ls>
        <ls>Sea-Surface Temperatures (SST): The temperature at the top layer of the ocean</ls>
        <ls>Wind Speed: The rate at which the wind is moving on the ocean surface</ls>
        <ls>Dust Concentration: The amount of dust present in a volume of the atmosphere</ls>
      </ul>
 
  </Prose>

    including the amount of sunlight, nutrient availability, sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidity. Cloud cover and aerosols in the atmosphere both block sunlight and thus affect the ocean chlorophyll amount. Studies show that when the amount of sunlight is reduced by clouds, the deeper layers of the ocean are most affected and thus plankton growth is concentrated at the surface and can lead to an increase in chlorophyll near the ocean surface. Nutrient availability can be affected by atmospheric aerosols, especially dust which can directly fall into the ocean or may get washed out by rain into the ocean. However, when rain washes out dust from the atmosphere, it can also bring other particles and soluble gases present in the atmosphere which can affect ocean acidity. Sea surface temperature influence on chlorophyll is complex, with chlorophyll concentration increasing with SST in some regions of the globe and vice versa in other regions.

     We used datasets for cloud cover, direct deposition and rain washout of dust, sea surface temperature and rain generated by the NASA Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA2) dataset to examine which factors are important for explaining increasing chlorophyll trends over TNA. Our statistical modeling shows that cloud cover, direct dust fallout and SST all have a positive influence on chlorophyll concentrations in the TNA region. However, rain and dust washed out by rain on to ocean, both have a negative influence. While increases in cloud cover and SST will cause chlorophyll concentration to increase, monthly average time series over the TNA region obtained from NASA MERRA show no increasing trend during 2015-2023 (Figure 2 and 3). However, the time series of direct dust fallout obtained from NASA MERRA shows an increasing trend during the same time period (Figure 4). Both rain and rain washout of dust show a decreasing trend during the 2015-2023 time period. This implies that the detrimental effect of rain on plankton growth is reduced during this time period. Thus our analysis shows that increasing chlorophyll and plankton growth is driven by increasing dust deposits and decreasing rainfall in the TNA region.

    ## Conclusion
    Implications of our analysis are that the changes in climate occurring over the TNA region and the Sahel are leading to an increase in plankton growth in the TNA region. This in turn leads to the added removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse and the major driver of human-induced climate change.
