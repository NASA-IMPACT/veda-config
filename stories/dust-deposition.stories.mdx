    ## Introduction
    The Earth system is large and complex, made up of many interconnected parts involving the land, ocean, and atmosphere. These parts affect each other in many ways and can even influence the greater global economy. One primary example of this is phytoplankton. This tiny, but mighty organism is one of the most important organisms in the ocean. Phytoplankton are the base of the ocean food chain, feeding fish and other marine life. This makes understanding how phytoplankton react to various conditions, including dust deposition and meteorological factors, vitally important. A specific region that can be observed to analyze these effects is the Tropical Northern Atlantic Ocean (TNAO), where frequent dust plumes are carried after originating from the Saharan Desert in Northern Africa. Dust from these plumes eventually settles onto the ocean surface and deposition can be enhanced through rainfall. This process adds key nutrients to the water, helping phytoplankton grow quickly and large in number.

    ## Understanding the Way Dust Connects Land, Ocean, and Life Through NASA Earth Observing Tools

    A variety of NASA satellite observations and models help scientists explore the complex interactions between land and ocean that are influenced by dust. NASA's MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), an Earth-observing satellite sensor, detects these changes by measuring ocean chlorophyll—a pigment that indicates the presence of phytoplankton. Additionally, NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, launched in 2024, continues to monitor ocean biology through the amount of sunlight reflected back to space that may be affected by atmospheric dust or other aerosols.

    While satellite sensors allow for monitoring both dust and phytoplankton activity, meteorological variables are needed to analyze this interconnected relationship. NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) provides detailed, three-dimensional wind, temperature, and moisture data, which is essential when determining the influences between dust transport and ocean productivity.

    The different meteorological variables that may impact and affect phytoplankton across the TNAO include: 

    <li>**Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD):** A measure of how much sunlight is blocked or scattered by aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere)</li>
    <li>**Cloud Cover:** Fraction or percentage of the sky covered by clouds</li>
    <li>**Sea-Surface Temperatures (SST):** The temperature at the top layer of the ocean</li>
    <li>**Wind Speed:** The rate at which the wind is moving on the ocean surface</li>
    <li>**Dust Concentration:** The amount of dust present in a volume of the atmosphere</li>

    Over the past 20 years, data has shown that chlorophyll-a levels – which is a direct indicator of phytoplankton – have been rising in the TNAO (Figure 1). The observed increase in phytoplankton compared to previous years alludes to a potential meteorological influence.

    ## AOD and Phytoplankton 

    At the same time, long-term satellite observations from MODIS sensors as well as MERRA-2 reanalysis data have recorded slightly higher levels of aerosols over the same 20-year period, which in this region are mostly caused by dust (Figure 2). The fact that both aerosols and chlorophyll-a have increased together points to a possible connection: more dust blowing into the ocean may be helping fertilize the water, leading to more phytoplankton growth.

    This trend would seem to imply that the more dust deposition there is, the more abundant the phytoplankton are. However, when comparing AOD directly to chlorophyll-a, a negative trend is revealed, suggesting that dust alone cannot be the sole cause of increasing phytoplankton concentrations across the TNAO. 
  </Prose>

<Block>
  <Prose>
    ## Cloud Cover and Phytoplankton

    However, phytoplankton growth depends on many factors besides dust. Even when dust adds nutrients to the ocean, it doesn’t always lead to more phytoplankton if the water already has enough nutrients. In fact, dust in the air can block some sunlight from reaching the ocean surface, which can reduce photosynthesis and slow plankton growth. Clouds have a similar effect by cutting down the amount of sunlight.

    Interestingly, though, recent data shows that phytoplankton populations have still increased in recent years, even though cloud cover has also shown an increasing trend (Figure 3). Normally, more clouds would limit the sunlight needed for photosynthesis, leading to less phytoplankton. But the steady rise in chlorophyll-a levels suggests that cloudiness by itself has not been enough to hold back phytoplankton growth.

  <Prose>
    ## Rainfall and Phytoplankton

    Although more cloud cover has shown an increasing trend over the past two decades, rainfall in this region has actually decreased over time. This decline in rain could be changing how dust gets deposited onto the ocean surface. Usually, rain helps wash dust out of the air—a process called wet deposition. But with less rain, more dust may be settling straight onto the ocean surface (dry deposition), bringing nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth. This change in how dust is delivered could help explain why chlorophyll-a levels keep rising despite more cloud cover.

    Rainfall itself also plays an important role. It can carry dust and nutrients into the ocean, which sometimes supports plankton growth. On the other hand, rain can also wash away gases like carbon dioxide or change the chemistry of seawater in ways that might limit plankton activity.

    <Prose>
    ## Vertical Mixing and Phytoplankton

    There is a slightly increasing trend in SST over the past two decades in the TNAO (Figure 5). In general, cooler SSTs can be a sign that mixing and upwelling are bringing nutrients from deeper layers up to the surface, which supports phytoplankton growth. Warmer SSTs, on the other hand, often indicate less mixing and fewer nutrients reaching the surface.

    However, when looking at how phytoplankton respond to rising SST in this region, chlorophyll-a concentrations have still increased over time. This suggests that SST itself isn’t directly controlling phytoplankton growth. Instead, SST acts more like an indicator of underlying ocean processes happening below the surface, such as upwelling, that affect how many nutrients are available for phytoplankton to use.

    <Prose>
    ## Wind Speed and Phytoplankton 

    Wind speed directly influences nutrient mixing in the ocean, which supports phytoplankton growth. Stronger winds cause more mixing, bringing nutrients from deeper waters to the surface. Sea surface temperature (SST) can reflect the effects of this mixing but does not cause it. According to MERRA-2-derived monthly mean values, wind speeds have slightly decreased across the TNAO (Figure 6).

    However, the effect of wind speed on phytoplankton is consistent with the previously discussed rationale of upwelling nutrients for phytoplankton. This indicates that when winds are relatively strong, mixing processes can still occur.

    ## Dust Concentration and Phytoplankton

    Higher concentrations of Saharan dust are being transported and deposited across the surface of the TNAO over the time period examined (Figure 7). This has a positive influence on chlorophyll-a levels, indicating that phytoplankton are responding to increased dust deposition across the surface of the TNAO. Additionally, the rate of direct dust deposition settling into the ocean has shown an increasing trend.

    ## Conclusion
    NASA Earth observation data products revealed that phytoplankton growth across the TNAO is primarily associated with decreasing trends in rainfall and increasing concentrations of dust deposition on the ocean surface. While rising dust and phytoplankton trends have been studied before, the role of decreasing rainfall and how dust delivered directly versus washed out by rain differently affects ocean biology, adds new understanding to these complex interactions. These environmental conditions provide an abundant supply of crucial nutrients to the phytoplankton from incoming dust plumes, allowing them to flourish. 

    These changing environmental conditions appear to have created an abundant supply of nutrients for phytoplankton. Specifically, less rainfall means less dust is removed by rain and more dust settles straight onto the ocean surface, supporting higher phytoplankton growth. While past studies have explored how dust fertilizes the ocean, this research adds new understanding by highlighting the importance of declining rainfall and shifts in how dust is delivered.

    Ultimately, sustainability practices of phytoplankton populations are essential to the neighboring coastal communities within this region, including Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Sierra Leone (Map 3). Fisheries are a dominant part of these countries’ food supply, economy, and overall, livelihood. Specifically, the fishing industries of  these West African countries make up as much as 30% of national revenue. This includes the exportation of fish around the world, making up a several billion dollar industry. In 2008, exports to the European Union alone made up about $1.75 billion in revenue to West Africa. More recently, the United States imported nearly $30 million worth of tuna, mollusks, octopus, and shrimp from Senegal during 2019. As phytoplankton productivity increases across the TNAO, so does marine biodiversity, which in turn supports the sustainable livelihoods of West African communities that depend on marine resources. Understanding what drives phytoplankton productivity in this region is essential for protecting local ecosystems and supporting seafood supply chains that benefit consumers worldwide.
