        San Francisco government officials pledged in 2021 to significantly reduce the city’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Leaders of New York, London, Los Angeles, and many other cities have announced similar goals, which aim to help curb global climate change while also improving public health and spurring innovation.
        
        Cities have implemented a variety of measures to meet their goals. These include expanding the use of renewable energy and incentivizing residents to use electric cars, bikes, or simply walk instead of driving gasoline-fueled cars.

        But a challenge for city leaders is to measure if policies are working. One option to measure effectiveness is a web of affordable sensors that track pollutants in real-time, according to a research team from the University of California, Berkeley. The team has been testing their idea since 2013 through sensors they built and dispersed throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The project has since expanded to Los Angeles; Providence, Rhode Island; and Glasgow in Scotland.

        Each sensor, about the size of a shoebox, measures carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen oxides, particles, and other pollutants about every five seconds.

        With a web of sensors in place, known as the Berkeley Environmental Air Quality and CO₂ Network, the team monitors immediate changes, such as a spike in pollution from wildfires, as well as tracking emissions over time.

        In April 2024, the researchers published a report showing the Bay Area’s progress in reducing CO₂ emissions. They found a 1.8% decline annually after analyzing data collected by 57 sensors between 2018 and 2022.

        Naomi Asimow, a graduate student who helps lead the project, is optimistic about these results: “In a lot of places in the world, emissions are still increasing, so the decrease in the Bay Area is a win.”

        After accounting for the effects of pandemic shutdowns and seasonal changes in CO₂ (home heating emissions have a large seasonal cycle, as does plant activity), Berkeley researchers found that the biggest change during their study period was in CO₂ emissions from cars and trucks.

        Although people drove less during the pandemic, traffic levels quickly returned to normal. However, CO₂ emissions didn’t go back to what they were before. The researchers suspect this is because more people in the Bay Area started using electric and fuel-efficient cars, which is consistent with vehicle registration data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

        ## The Challenges of Tracking Emissions 
        Accurately tracking emissions on a local scale is challenging for many reasons. It’s expensive to blanket a city with devices that measure pollutants, for one, and keeping them functioning requires maintenance.  Satellites collect data over cities around the world, though decision-makers also benefit from complementary local data sources to add further context for their own unique city characteristics.
        
        As a result, many cities and municipalities track emissions indirectly, and sometimes imprecisely, by inferring the information from economic activity data or highway vehicle counts, and by relying on self-reported measurements from high-polluting sectors. There is also the challenge of interpreting whether fluctuations in emissions are due to policies, natural disasters, seasons, pandemics, or other factors.

        Berkeley scientists say the promise of their network is in placing lots of lower-cost sensors about 1 mile, or 2 kilometers, apart. The Bay Area sensors sit mostly on public-school rooftops, which are conveniently dispersed every few kilometers and have Wi-Fi to keep sensors online and send data continuously.
        
        Besides logistical benefits, having schools host sensors adds educational value, Asimow said: “It’s a really nice way to bring the students into the project.” Asimow and her colleagues work with middle- and high-school students to analyze the data collected at their schools.

        Asimow notes that the sensors themselves are cost-effective. At about $10,000 apiece, Berkeley’s sensors track six chemical compounds and tiny particles at high accuracy, 1 part per million for CO₂. Although the group’s sensors aren’t as precise as top-of-the-line models, the density of their network compensates by allowing cities to cover more area, Berkeley researchers say.   

        The researchers also wanted to consider how emissions carried from other regions by wind would impact measurements taken locally in San Francisco. Using satellite-based observations and modeling data from NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System, they were able to identify and correct for outside emissions sources and, therefore, examine with greater confidence the impact of local policy measures like vehicle electrification.

        A dense network, combined with data quality control and sophisticated computer models that help interpret the measured concentrations, could help overcome some of the challenges local officials face in tracking their progress toward meeting emissions reductions goals.
