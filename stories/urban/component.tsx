                    Cities and metropolitan regions, where most of the world's population live, are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FactSheet_Urban_Systems.pdf">responsible for approximately 70% of greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Researchers are making rapid advances in urban emissions measurement and modeling to provide robust, accurate, and reliable emissions estimates at fine scales, even down to building and street level. For urban decision makers, this trustworthy local data offers the opportunity to establish accurate baselines for greenhouse gas emissions, identify trends, track carbon mitigation performance, and develop effective and efficient climate solutions.
