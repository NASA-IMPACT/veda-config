    ⚠️ This visualization was created using a [jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel](https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel) and
    [voici](https://voici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is rendered client-side (in your browser!) via the magic of [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/).
    This is an exciting and rapidly evolving space which means that this
    visualization is highly experimental and likely to break. ⚠️
