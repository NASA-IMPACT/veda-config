    Showing large fires that were burning when the fire atlas was last updated.
    Only includes fires with an area greater than 2.

    You can learn more about how to access [this data](https://firenrt.delta-backend.com/collections/public.eis_fire_snapshot_perimeter_nrt) directly in this [VEDA documentation page](https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/notebooks/tutorials/mapping-fires.html).

    ⚠️ This visualization was created using a [jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel](https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel) and
    [voici](https://voici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is rendered client-side (in your browser!) via the magic of [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/).
    This is an exciting and rapidly evolving space which means that this
    visualization is highly experimental and likely to break. ⚠️
