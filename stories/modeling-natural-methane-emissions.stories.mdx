  Increasing methane in the atmosphere, whether from fossil fuels, landfills, grazing animals, wetlands, or wildfires, has the same effect no matter the source: The potent greenhouse gas is a major contributor to rising global temperatures.

  As stakeholders – from facility operators to land managers to governments – work to reduce these methane emissions, however, knowing their source becomes key to tracking success. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center portal houses several complementary resources to identify sources and estimated levels of atmospheric methane.

  About a third of methane emissions are from wetlands, generated naturally as a byproduct of microbes in oxygen-depleted soils. That microscopic level is where researcher Ben Poulter, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, started building the <Link to='/data-catalog/lpjeosim-wetlandch4-grid-v1'>NASA Wetlands Methane Emissions Model</Link>, which incorporates satellite observations, measurements from field campaigns such as [BlueFlux](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/nasas-blueflux-campaign-supports-blue-carbon-management-in-south-florida/), and information about weather patterns.

  “We rely on understanding the mechanics of how microbes produce methane, and how that’s related to temperature, moisture, soil type, etc.,” Poulter said. “The goal is to help us understand how much methane is coming from global wetlands, and then use that information to look at whether changes in temperature are influencing that trend.”

                Wetlands, like this mangrove forest in south Florida that was one of the sites of NASA’s Blue Flux field campaign, are a major natural source of methane emissions, generated by microbes in the water-logged and oxygen depleted soils. Scientists use a variety of tools to measure how these sources contribute to the global methane budget, including the NASA Wetland Methane Emissions Model available in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center.

  In the tropics, microbes become more active when temperatures are higher, and wetter conditions lead to more flooding and therefore more oxygen-depleted soils. In the Arctic, thawing permafrost frees up buried carbon that had previously been frozen in place and inaccessible to microbes.

  If wetlands are producing more methane as temperatures rise, that increase in emissions could dampen some of the progress made by reducing emissions from sources related to human activities.

  “I think it emphasizes the need to take an Earth system perspective on the global methane budget,” Poulter said. “There are immediate opportunities to address anthropogenic sources, but at the same time, now that we’re seeing farther-reaching temperature impacts on Earth systems, we need to keep track of the more natural sources of greenhouse gasses as well.”

            This animation produced by NASA’s Wetland Methane Emissions Model shows concentrated methane sources from tropical and high latitude ecosystems. The model is regularly used to simulate the impact of wetlands and other method sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions.

  While the wetlands methane model starts, literally, from the ground up, other models – such as NOAA’s <Link to="/data-catalog/ct-ch4-monthgrid-v2023" >Carbon Tracker Methane Emissions </Link> – take the opposite approach. This methane tracker ingests atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration data along with other conditions like winds and weather and then estimates emissions, said Lori Bruhwiler, a physical scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.

  “We’re not trying to forecast the future concentrations of methane, instead these numerical techniques go back in time to find the distribution and fluxes of methane sources over the past several decades,” Bruhwiler said.

  NOAA also has a tool to track carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, but methane is such a different compound that it needs its own specific model, she said. Once in the atmosphere, CO2 is very stable and can last for 300 to 1,000 years. Methane, on the other hand, reacts with other gasses in the atmosphere and is removed by atmospheric chemistry, resulting in an atmospheric half-life of about 10 years.

  “That’s why there’s so much attention on methane,” Bruhwiler said. “If emissions decrease, and what’s already there is removed within 10 years, there can be a near term benefit of avoided temperature increases.”

  This effort, however, is complicated by the numerous sources of methane. Emissions are the result of unintentional oil and gas pipeline or coal mine leaks, agricultural sources (livestock and rice), landfills, sewage waste, reservoirs, wildfires, wetlands and permafrost thawing – it’s a challenge to determine the budget of what is from natural sources, and what is human-caused, she said.

Wildfires are a natural source of pyrogenic methane emissions which contribute to global atmospheric concentrations of the gas.

  While NOAA’s model uses information from a global network of surface sampling sites, other models take a space-based vantage point and utilize satellite observations to fill in gaps in data. NASA's Carbon Monitoring System Flux team in partnership with Harvard University uses measurements from Japan’s Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite, or <Link to="/data-catalog/gosat-based-ch4budget-yeargrid-v1">GOSAT,</Link> to derive spatially-resolved estimates of total global methane emissions, as well as source-specific estimates for wetlands and various human-related emissions.

  Quantifying different forms of methane to help decipher their source is critically important to understand global trends in methane. As researchers develop innovative and complementary models and methods of observation, they gain new insights into the complex balance of natural and human-caused sources of methane.

  Findings also contribute to cooperative international research efforts like the Global Carbon Project’s [Global Methane Budget](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/methanebudget/), and allow decision-makers to track progress of initiatives including the [Global Methane Pledge](https://www.globalmethanepledge.org/), in which more than 150 countries committed to reducing methane emissions by 30 percent of 2020 levels by the end of the decade.
