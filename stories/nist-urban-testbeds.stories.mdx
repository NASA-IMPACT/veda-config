        Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. region may not have a great deal in common when it comes to weather, terrain, and economic activity. Their diversity as urban environments, however, is precisely why they were chosen by researchers for an innovative program  to test and improve the accuracy of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates in U.S. cities.
        [NIST’s Urban GHG Measurements Testbed System](https://www.nist.gov/greenhouse-gas-measurements/urban-test-beds) brings together scientists from U.S. government agencies, including NIST, NOAA and NASA, in partnership with universities, the private sector and local governments, to solve measurement challenges and develop new methods with the power to transform the way we monitor and measure GHGs in the future.

        ## Bottom-Up and Top-Down Methods
        “Bottom-up” GHG emissions estimates can be calculated using data that describes activities like highway traffic, energy production, and agriculture. These are combined with information that describes the intensity of emissions for each kind of activity, which can vary by economic sector, technology, and geographic region.

        A complementary and increasingly powerful tool involves taking direct measurements of GHG concentrations in Earth’s atmosphere, studying subtle changes that may be associated with weather, seasonal variations, and atmospheric chemistry, and making inferences about the reasons for observed fluctuations. Researchers refer to these as “top-down” approaches.

        Comparing the two approaches helps reduce uncertainties and improve the overall accuracy of greenhouse gas emissions estimates. This is where the NIST testbed system comes in. It is designed to aid researchers in combining top-down and bottom-up approaches in key regions.

            Indianapolis is the site of NIST’s longest-running urban testbed, which began in 2010 as the Indianapolis Flux Experiment, also known as INFLUX. These long-standing atmospheric measurements offer a unique and valuable opportunity to assess changes and trends in greenhouse gases around Indianapolis.

        Across the three urban areas, researchers have set sensors on building rooftops and communications towers to measure concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. The observations from these ground-based networks include 14 sites in and around the Los Angeles basin, 8 across Indianapolis, and 28 across the Northeast, including 15 in the Baltimore/D.C. region.

        This data can be combined with airborne measurements obtained by NOAA and NASA aircraft and satellite missions, yielding even more complete coverage across urban areas.

        The high accuracy, detailed observations collected at the testbed sites can help researchers identify specific emissions sources such as neighborhoods, transportation networks, or landfills, and to track how those emissions change over time. This information is critically important for decision-makers seeking to track progress in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

      ## An Inter-Agency Prototype for Greenhouse Gas Monitoring
        NIST and NOAA have teamed up on the [Urban GHG Measurement and Monitoring System](https://www.arl.noaa.gov/research/atmospheric-transport-and-dispersion/urban-gemms/) (Urban-GEMMS), aiming to integrate sophisticated bottom-up and top-down methods into a first-of-its-kind urban-scale, operational GHG monitoring system prototype. They chose the Baltimore/D.C. region for their initial demonstration site because it already has an extensive network of surface and airborne observational systems, though they also plan to implement the system across other urban areas and regional and national scales in the future.

        The primary benefit of an integrated system is in reducing the lag between collecting data and making the resulting GHG emissions estimates available. By providing emissions estimates multiple times throughout the year, this project can support efforts to monitor GHG emissions and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation policies by stakeholders like regional and local city planners and federal agencies.
