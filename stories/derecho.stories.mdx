    ## Overview
    On the morning of May 12, 2022, the Plains were calm, but by midday, a powerful serial derechoâ€”a fast-moving, long-lasting windstormâ€”swept across Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. The storm brought extreme winds over 100 mph, EF2 tornadoes (which can tear apart buildings and trees), large 2.5-inch hail, and thick dust storms. This storm badly damaged farms, which are a key part of the local economy. Corn and soybean fields were destroyed, reducing harvests. Strong winds and hail also wrecked grain silos, irrigation systems, and rural buildings, causing serious financial trouble for farmers. Beyond farming, the derecho disrupted food supply chains and businesses that depend on steady shipments.

    The storm covered over 600 miles at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, showing how unprepared many rural communities were for severe weather. Because there werenâ€™t enough protections in place, the damage was widespread, and emergency responders struggled to keep up. This derecho set records for the number of powerful wind gusts, with straight-line winds reaching 60 to over 100 mphâ€”similar in strength to a Category 1 hurricane or an EF0 to EF1 tornado. The winds also lifted thick dust into the air, making it hard to see in southeastern South Dakota and slowing down rescue efforts. This event shows the urgent need for stronger buildings, better weather protection, and improved disaster response to help rural communities and farms recover from future storms.

  ## Datatsets Utilized
  This story looks at the stormâ€™s effects using different types of data. GOES Satellite and NEXRAD radar images show the stormâ€™s bow-shaped structure, which caused strong, damaging winds. They also reveal overshooting cloud topsâ€”tall clouds that indicate powerful updrafts and intense storms. Reports from the National Weather Service (NWS) describe the tornadoes, hail, and strong winds that added to the destruction. The NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit provides a detailed visualization of tornado tracks, showing where these storms caused the most damage. Rainfall data from IMERG highlights how heavy rain led to soil erosion and flooding. VIIRS Night Lights data reveals major power outages, especially in rural areas where losing electricity makes recovery harder. MAXAR Worldview-4 satellite imagery captures high-resolution views of the damage, offering a clear picture of the stormâ€™s impact on infrastructure, agriculture, and communities. MERRA-2 data tracks dust and tiny particles in the air, illustrating how the storm worsened air quality and led to breathing problems for many people. Additionally, data from NASA SPoRT-LIS helps identify the extent of drought conditions leading up to the storm, which contributed to widespread dust transport by high winds. Together, these datasets help us understand the full impact of the storm on the Northern Plains.

  ## What is a Derecho?
  A derecho is a long-lasting, fast-moving windstorm that comes from a line of severe thunderstorms. For a storm to be called a derecho, it must cause wind damage along at least 400 miles (650 km), with several wind gusts over 75 mph (120 km/h) and sustained winds of at least 58 mph (93 km/h). Unlike single thunderstorms, derechos form within mesoscale convective systems (MCS)â€”large storm clusters that produce strong, long-lasting straight-line winds.

  **Conditions that help a derecho form include:**
  * **Strong instability** (Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) over 2000-4000 J/kg): This provides energy for strong updrafts and intense thunderstorms.
  * **High low-level moisture** (dew points of 65-75Â°F): This keeps storms going by supplying moisture.
  * **Strong mid- and upper-level winds** (wind shear over 40 knots): This helps organize storms and push them forward.
  * **A well-defined cold pool**: Rain-cooled air at the surface strengthens the storm by increasing wind speeds at the front of the system.

  **Where and when do derechos occur?**
  Derechos happen most often in the central and eastern U.S., especially in the Corn Belt, where the conditions for strong storms are most common. They can also occur in the Southeast and, less often, in the Northeast (Figure 1). Some research suggests that derechos could become more frequent or intense due to rising temperatures, which increase atmospheric instability and change storm patterns. However, scientists are still studying long-term trends.

  ## Detecting Derechos
  There are two main ways to identify derechosâ€”by using Doppler radar and satellite images.

  On Doppler radar, derechos usually have a bow echo shape, which looks like a curved or arched line of storms. Key radar features include:
  * **Intense reflectivity along the leading edge**: Shows the strongest storms and heaviest rain.
  * **Rear-inflow jet (RIJ) signatures**: Strong mid-level winds that reach the surface, adding to the stormâ€™s power.
  * **Gust front propagation**: A boundary of cool air ahead of the storm that creates intense winds.
  * **Embedded mesovortices**: Small areas of rotation inside the storm, which can sometimes lead to tornadoes.

  Satellite images help scientists better understand how derechos form and develop. Important satellite features include:
  * **Overshooting tops in infrared (IR) images**: Show areas of extremely strong thunderstorms.
  * **Expanding anvil clouds**: Indicate that the storm is growing and lasting longer.
  * **Cold cloud tops (~-70Â°C)**: Reveal powerful updrafts that push storm clouds high into the atmosphere, reaching the tropopause (the boundary between the lower and upper atmosphere).
  * **Dust transport seen in GOES satellite images**: Derechos can lift large amounts of dust into the air, reducing visibility. In some cases, this creates a haboob, an intense dust storm.

  ## May 12, 2022 Northern Plains Derecho - Case Study
  The May 12, 2022, derecho was very intense, producing widespread wind gusts of 80-100 mph across Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa, with some gusts exceeding 105 mph. The event was also unique in that it was classified as a "hot serial derecho", meaning it developed in an environment characterized by extreme heat, instability, and formed along a longer line of storms. With extreme CAPE at about 5000 J/kg, the presence of very unstable air allowed for intense updrafts, fueling deep convection. Similarly, surface temperatures reached 90-100Â°F in some areas, allowing dry air from aloft to mix down and enhance wind speeds. A powerful low-level jet helped accelerate storm movement, leading to widespread high winds (Figure X). Storms initiated along a sharp dryline, with a trailing cold front reinforcing the storm organization. This derecho was particularly destructive due to the sheer extent of high winds, with a large swath of 80+ mph gusts and an embedded tornado outbreak.

   Not only did the extreme winds cause extensive damage to infrastructure, the storm carried immense amounts of dust, forming an intense dust storm called a haboob. This was specifically bad, due to the drought experienced in the region that caused top soils to easily blow off farm fields. This caused reduced visibility to near zero in many rural areas, creating both a travel hazard for many motorists caught on the roadways while destroying the farmland in the central and eastern parts of the state.

   ## South Dakota
    
   As the derecho advanced into South Dakota around 4:10 pm, it maintained its strength and continued to be destructive on the surrounding cities. Winds of 80â€“107 mph were recorded, causing extensive damage to neighboring cities such as Tripp and Dell Rapids, South Dakota. Farmers who rely on these silos to store harvested crops were left facing massive economic losses, as the storm compromised their ability to store grain for future distribution and sale. In some cases, entire storage facilities were rendered inoperable, forcing producers to seek emergency storage solutions or risk spoilage of their remaining harvest.

   ## Iowa

   Due to the large-scale of this severe storm, the derecho spanned into northwestern Iowa by 5:30 pm while it still ravaged South Dakota at the same time. Although there was only one brief tornado reported in the area with minimal damage, a similar situation like Nebraska manifested as an intense dust storm also reduced visibility across major highways and agricultural zones. Wind gusts of 70-90 mph were reported, leading to toppled power lines and substantial damage to farm structures, impacting both crops and livestock facilities.

  ## Community Consequences and Emergency Response
  The May 12, 2022, derecho had a devastating impact on rural communities, showing how vulnerable they are to extreme weather. The agriculture sector was hit hardest, with corn and soybean fieldsâ€”a major part of the regionâ€™s economyâ€”flattened within minutes. 

  Data from the USDA crop distribution map and storm reports show that the derechoâ€™s strongest winds, hail, and tornadoes directly hit some of the most important farming areas in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota. Wind gusts over 100 mph (similar to the strength of a weak hurricane) caused widespread lodging (where corn stalks are bent or broken by the wind), while hail shredded plant leaves and bruised crops, reducing harvest quality and yield. Many grain silos, irrigation systems, and farm buildings were also damaged or destroyed, adding to the financial burden on farmers.

  Beyond farms, the economic impact spread further. Even when grain silos werenâ€™t completely destroyed, many lost power, making it impossible to ventilate and store grain properly. Despite community efforts to clear roads and restore power, the recovery process was slow and difficult, exposing the challenges rural areas face after such a disaster.

  The derecho also tested the effectiveness of emergency response systems. While early warnings helped some residents prepare, the storm moved so quickly and with such intensity that many were caught off guard. Emergency responders struggled to reach damaged areas due to blocked roads, power outages, and a second round of storms that followed. With so much destruction, the South Dakota governor declared a state of emergency for 20 counties, allowing more resources to be used for disaster relief and recovery efforts.

  ## Conclusion and Future Outlook
  Looking ahead, derechos like this one could become more frequent and intense due to climate extremes. As global temperatures rise, the atmosphere becomes more unstable and holds more moisture, creating better conditions for severe storms. If this trend continues, stronger derechos could become more common, increasing the risk of destruction in rural communities.

  For farmers, the impacts of a derecho donâ€™t end after the storm. The immediate damage to crops, grain silos, and irrigation systems is devastating, but the long-term effects can be even worse. Soil erosion, caused by high winds and heavy rain, can reduce land productivity, making it harder to grow crops in the future. Farmers also face financial struggles due to lost harvests, damaged equipment, and the rising cost of repairs and rebuilding.

  To reduce future damage, communities must focus on stronger infrastructure, better forecasting, and improved emergency plans. Rural areas could benefit from more wind-resistant buildings, upgraded power systems, and better storm shelters. Government programs will also need to provide financial aid and disaster relief to help farmers recover faster.

  As extreme weather events become more common, taking action now is crucial. Protecting farmland, improving emergency preparedness, and strengthening infrastructure are not just important for farmersâ€”they are necessary for keeping local economies stable. By investing in resilience, communities can better protect themselves from future disasters and reduce the impact of derechos in the years to come.
