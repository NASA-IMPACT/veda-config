    ## Overview
    On the morning of May 12, 2022, the plains were calm, but by midday, a powerful serial derechoâ€”a fast-moving, long-lasting windstormâ€”swept across Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. The storm unleashed extreme winds over 100 mph, EF2 tornadoes (which can demolish buildings and trees), 2.5-inch diameter hail, and thick dust storms. Many farms were severely damaged, creating financial difficulty for farmers and a negative impact on the local economy. Corn and soybean fields were destroyed, reducing harvests. Strong winds and hail also wrecked grain silos, irrigation systems, and rural buildings. Beyond farming, the derecho disrupted food supply chains and businesses that rely on regular deliveries. Strong winds and power outages forced grain elevators, food processing plants, and distribution centers to shut down temporarily, causing delays in shipments and product shortages. Roads were also blocked or damaged, making it harder for trucks to transport goods and further slowing down the supply chain.

  This derecho set a record for the number of powerful wind gusts, with straight-line winds reaching 60 to over 100 mphâ€”similar in strength to a Category 1 hurricane or an EF0 to EF1 tornado. The storm linearly covered over 600 miles at speeds of 50 to 70 mph.  While local communities have weathered many derechos over the years, this storm was unique in its severity because there werenâ€™t enough protections in place. Therefore, the damage was widespread, and emergency responders struggled to keep up. In southeastern South Dakota, the strong winds whipped dust clouds into the air, making it hard to see and slowing down rescue efforts. This event highlights the urgent need for stronger buildings, better weather protection, and improved disaster response protocols to help rural communities and farms prepare for and recover from future storms.

  ## What is a Derecho?
  A derecho is a long-lasting, fast-moving windstorm that is produced from a line of severe thunderstorms. For a storm to be called a derecho, it must cause wind damage along at least 400 miles (650 km), with wind gusts over 75 mph (120 km/h) and sustained winds of at least 58 mph (93 km/h). Unlike single thunderstorms, derechos form within mesoscale (i.e., mid-sized) convective systems (MCS)â€”large storm clusters that produce strong, long-lasting straight-line winds.

  **Conditions that help a derecho form include:**
  * **Strong instability** (Convective available potential energy (CAPE) over 2000-4000 J/kg): provides energy for strong updrafts and intense thunderstorms.
  * **High low-level moisture** (dew points of 65-75Â°F): keeps storms going by supplying moisture.
  * **Strong mid- and upper-level winds** (wind shear over 40 knots): help organize storms and push them forward.
  * **A well-defined cold pool**: rain-cooled air at the surface strengthens the storm by increasing wind speeds at the front of the system.

  **Where and when do derechos occur?**

  Derechos happen most often in the central and eastern U.S., especially in the Corn Belt, where conditions for strong storms are most common. They can also occur in the Southeast and, less often, in the Northeast (Figure 1). Some research suggests that derechos could become more frequent or intense due to rising temperatures, which increase atmospheric instability and change storm patterns. However, scientists are still studying long-term trends.

  ## Detecting Derechos
  Researchers identify derechos either through Doppler radar and satellite images.

  On Doppler radar, derechos usually have a bow echo shape, which looks like a curved or arched line of storms. Several key radar features are visible:
  * **Intense reflectivity along the leading edge**: shows the strongest storms and heaviest rain.
  * **Rear-inflow jet (RIJ) signatures**: strong mid-level winds that reach the surface, increasing the stormâ€™s power.
  * **Gust front propagation**: a boundary of cool air ahead of the storm that creates intense winds.
  * **Embedded mesovortices**: small areas of rotation inside the storm, which can sometimes lead to tornadoes.

  <Prose>
  Satellite images help scientists better understand how derechos form and develop. These images include important satellite features:
  * **Overshooting tops in infrared (IR) images**: show areas of extremely strong thunderstorms.
  * **Expanding anvil clouds**: indicate that the storm is growing and lasting longer.
  * **Cold cloud tops (~-70Â°C)**: reveal powerful updrafts that push storm clouds high into the atmosphere, reaching the tropopause (the boundary between the lower and upper atmosphere)
  * **Dust transport seen in GOES satellite images**: derechos can lift large amounts of dust into the air, reducing visibility. In some cases, this creates a haboob, an intense dust storm.

  ## May 12, 2022 Northern Plains Derecho - Case Study
  This particular derecho was fierce, producing widespread wind gusts of 80-100 mph across Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa, with some gusts exceeding 105 mph. The event was uniquely classified as a "hot serial derecho", meaning two derechos developed in an environment characterized by extreme heat and instability (Figure 2). With extreme CAPE at about 5000 J/kg, pockets of unstable air allowed for intense updrafts, fueling deep convection. Similarly, Hot surface temperatures of 90-100Â°F in some areas also allowed dry air from aloft to mix down and enhance wind speeds. A powerful low-level jet helped accelerate storm movement, leading to widespread high winds. Storms initiated along a sharp dryline (a front-like feature with a moisture gradient), with a trailing cold front reinforcing storm structure. This derecho was especially destructive due to the sheer extent of high winds, with a large swath of 80+ mph gusts and an embedded tornado outbreak.

  ### Drought Conditions Prior to Derecho Formation

  Before the May 12, 2022 derecho, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed that the Great Plains area was experiencing severe to extreme drought, with the worst conditions in central Nebraska. The GLDAS daily 0-10 cm topsoil moisture data (shown in the gif below) reveals that these drought conditions had been present since April 1, 2022, existing for over a month before the storm. With very low soil moisture, crops like corn and soybeans were likely more vulnerable to damage from the high winds and hail delivered by this powerful derecho.

  ### Nebraska

  #### ***The First Derecho Forms***
    
  At 2:50 PM CST on May 12, 2022, the derecho began in southern Nebraska, where severe thunderstorms quickly formed and organized into a fast-moving line. As the storm moved northeast, it became even stronger, producing widespread straight-line winds of 60-80 mph. Some areas, like Hartington, Nebraska, experienced gusts up to 100 mph.

  The stormâ€™s intensity was clear from the damage it caused. A 300-foot 911 cell tower was completely twisted and mangled, as seen in satellite images, showing the power of the derechoâ€™s winds.

  MAXAR imagery helps track storm impacts by providing high-resolution satellite images with detailed panchromatic and multispectral capabilities. This level of detail allows scientists to monitor changes in vegetation, soil, and infrastructure before and after the storm with greater precision. Unlike lower-resolution satellites like MODIS, MAXAR imagery can capture wind-damaged crop rows, fallen trees, and areas of soil erosion in much finer detail, offering a clearer picture of storm-related damage.

  ### Nebraska

  #### ***Dry Topsoil Becomes Airborne***

  The extreme winds from the derecho didnâ€™t just damage infrastructure; they also carried massive amounts of aerosol particles, creating a haboob (an intense dust storm). This was especially severe because the ongoing drought had dried out the soil, making it easy for the wind to lift and blow topsoil off farm fields.

  ### MERRA2 Dataset

  #### ***Visualization of Airborne Dust Particles***

  As seen in the MERRA-2 Total Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) gif below, the first derecho moved into South Dakota from Nebraska, carrying large amounts of dust into North Dakota and Minnesota. The second derecho, which followed later, moved into northwestern Iowa before continuing into Minnesota. Since this was a serial derecho, MERRA-2 satellite imagery helps track the movement of dust from both storm systems. It also provides a regional view, showing how aerosol particles traveled far beyond the central storm path. This imagery is especially useful when cloud cover makes it hard to see the dust with the naked eye.

  *Insert MERRA2 timeseries gif of dust transportation here*

  The MERRA-2 basemap data shows that northeastern Nebraska had a higher concentration of aerosols compared to the rest of the state. This dust transport led to near-zero visibility in many rural areas, making travel dangerous for motorists caught on the roads. The strong winds also stripped topsoil from farmland, causing further damage to crops and soil health.

  ### South Dakota

  #### ***Highest Wind Gusts Recorded During the Derecho***
    
  As the derecho moved into South Dakota by 4:10 PM CST, it remained extremely powerful and caused major destruction in several cities. Wind speeds of 97â€“107 mph were recorded, heavily damaging areas like Tripp and Dell Rapids, South Dakota. The highest wind gusts were concentrated over Dell Rapids, as shown in the basemap data imagery. The storm damaged or destroyed many storage facilities, leading to huge economic losses. Some farmers lost their grain silos, forcing them to find emergency storage for their crops or risk spoiling them before they could be sold.

  ### South Dakota

  #### ***Powerlines Topple Over from Winds***
    
  The intense winds from the derecho didnâ€™t just damage farmsâ€”they also caused widespread power outages in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

  To track these outages, VIIRS Night Lights data demonstrates images before and after the storm to show where power was lost. Unlike traditional outage reports that rely on self-reporting or utility records, VIIRS provides a clear, wide-area view of electricity disruptions.

  * Red pixels indicate areas where power outages occurred.
  * Blue pixels show areas that still have power.

  ### South Dakota

  #### ***Tornados Begin to Form***
   
  In Castlewood, South Dakota, the strongest tornado of the dayâ€”an EF2 tornadoâ€”tore through the town, destroying homes, barns, and grain bins with intense, straight-line winds. The town suffered widespread power outages and structural wreckage, as shown in the images below. The National Weather Service Damage Assessment Toolkit recorded the tornadoâ€™s path as it cut through the center of the city, leaving behind severe damage. Farmers faced major challenges in the aftermath, such as clearing massive debris scattered across their fields. Community rebuilding efforts required significant  coordination, resources, and time.

  ### Iowa

  #### ***Another Derecho Forms and Enters State-lines***

  By 5:30 PM, a second derecho formed and entered northwestern Iowa and southeastern South Dakota at the same time. Although one brief tornado caused some damage, most of the destruction came from straight-line winds. Wind gusts of 70-90 mph knocked down power lines and wiped out farm buildings, affecting both crops and livestock facilities.

  The derechoâ€™s powerful winds lifted large amounts of dust, particulate matter (PM), and debris into the air, creating hazardous air conditions across the region. MERRA2 imagery showed a spike in aerosol levels in northwestern Iowa, with dust and particles traveling hundreds of miles. This significantly worsened air quality far beyond the stormâ€™s path.

  ### Minnesota

  #### ***Straight-line Winds Batter Infrastructure***

  Upon entering Minnesota at 6:10 PM CST, the storm moved across the state with remarkable speed, leaving a swath of damage in its wake. This brought about more extreme winds, large hail, and multiple tornadoes. The strongest wind gusts, reaching 94 mph, were recorded in Madison, Minnesota. Farmers reported significant crop losses in some areas due to wind-driven hail and excessive rainfall. According to the National Weather Service in Twin Cities, several farm buildings were destroyed, and widespread debris littered the countryside, impacting livestock and agricultural operations.

  ## Community Consequences and Emergency Response
  The May 12, 2022 derecho had a devastating impact on rural communities, highlighting how vulnerable they are to extreme weather. The agriculture sector was hit hardest, with corn and soybean fieldsâ€”a major part of the regionâ€™s economyâ€”flattened within minutes. 

  Data from the USDA crop distribution map and storm reports show that the derechoâ€™s strongest winds, hail, and tornadoes directly hit some of the most important farming areas in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota. Wind gusts over 100 mph caused widespread lodging (where corn stalks are bent or broken by the wind), while hail shredded plant leaves and bruised crops, reducing harvest quality and yield.

  The economic impact reached beyond the crop fields. Many grain silos, irrigation systems, and farm buildings were also damaged or destroyed, adding to the financial burden on farmers. Even when grain silos werenâ€™t completely destroyed, many lost power, making it impossible to ventilate and store grain properly. Despite community efforts to clear roads and restore power, the recovery process was slow and difficult, exposing the challenges rural areas face after such a disaster.

  The derecho also tested the effectiveness of emergency response systems. While early warnings helped some residents prepare, the storm moved so quickly and with such intensity that many were caught off guard. Emergency responders struggled to reach damaged areas due to blocked roads, power outages, and a second round of storms that followed. With so much destruction, the South Dakota governor declared a state of emergency for 20 counties, enabling more resources to be used for disaster relief and recovery efforts.

  ## Conclusion and Future Outlook
  Looking ahead, derechos like this one could become more frequent and intense due to increasing climate variability. As global temperatures rise, the atmosphere becomes more unstable and holds more moisture, creating favorable conditions for severe storms. If this trend continues, stronger derechos could become more common, increasing the risk of destruction in rural communities.

  For farmers, the impacts of a derecho continue long after the storm dissipates. The immediate damage to crops, grain silos, and irrigation systems is devastating, but the long-term effects can be even worse. Soil erosion, caused by high winds and heavy rain, can reduce land productivity, making it harder to grow crops in the future. Farmers also face financial struggles due to lost harvests, damaged equipment, and the rising cost of repairs and rebuilding.

  To reduce future damage, communities must focus on stronger infrastructure, better forecasting, and improved emergency plans. Rural areas could benefit from more wind-resistant buildings, upgraded power systems, and better storm shelters. Government programs could also provide financial aid and disaster relief to help farmers recover faster.

  As extreme weather events become more likely in the future, taking action now is crucial. Protecting farmland, improving emergency preparedness, and strengthening infrastructure are not just important for farmersâ€”they are necessary for keeping local economies stable. By investing in resilience, communities can better prepare for future disasters and reduce the impact of derechos in the years to come.
