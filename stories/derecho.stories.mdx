    ## Overview
    On the morning of May 12, 2022, the Plains were calm, but by midday, a powerful serial derechoâ€”a fast-moving, long-lasting windstormâ€”swept across Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. The storm brought extreme winds over 100 mph, EF2 tornadoes (which can tear apart buildings and trees), large 2.5-inch hail, and thick dust storms (Video 1). This storm badly damaged farms, which are a key part of the local economy. Corn and soybean fields were destroyed, reducing harvests. Strong winds and hail also wrecked grain silos, irrigation systems, and rural buildings, causing serious financial trouble for farmers. Beyond farming, the derecho disrupted food supply chains and businesses that depend on steady shipments.

  The storm covered over 600 miles at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, showing how unprepared many rural communities were for severe weather. Because there werenâ€™t enough protections in place, the damage was widespread, and emergency responders struggled to keep up. This derecho set records for the number of powerful wind gusts, with straight-line winds reaching 60 to over 100 mphâ€”similar in strength to a Category 1 hurricane or an EF0 to EF1 tornado. The winds also lifted thick dust into the air, making it hard to see in southeastern South Dakota and slowing down rescue efforts. This event shows the urgent need for stronger buildings, better weather protection, and improved disaster response to help rural communities and farms recover from future storms.

  ## Datasets Utilized
  This story looks at the stormâ€™s effects using different types of data. GOES Satellite and NEXRAD radar images show the stormâ€™s bow-shaped structure, which caused strong, damaging winds. They also reveal overshooting cloud topsâ€”tall clouds that indicate powerful updrafts and intense storms. Reports from the National Weather Service (NWS) describe the tornadoes, hail, and strong winds that added to the destruction. The NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit provides a detailed visualization of tornado tracks, showing where these storms caused the most damage. Rainfall data from IMERG highlights how heavy rain led to soil erosion and flooding. VIIRS Night Lights data reveals major power outages, especially in rural areas where losing electricity makes recovery harder. MAXAR Worldview-4 satellite imagery captures high-resolution views of the damage, offering a clear picture of the stormâ€™s impact on infrastructure, agriculture, and communities. MERRA-2 data tracks dust and tiny particles in the air, illustrating how the storm worsened air quality and led to breathing problems for many people. Additionally, data from NASA SPoRT-LIS helps identify the extent of drought conditions leading up to the storm, which contributed to widespread dust transport by high winds. Together, these datasets help us understand the full impact of the storm on the Northern Plains.

  ## What is a Derecho?
  A derecho is a long-lasting, fast-moving windstorm that comes from a line of severe thunderstorms. For a storm to be called a derecho, it must cause wind damage along at least 400 miles (650 km), with several wind gusts over 75 mph (120 km/h) and sustained winds of at least 58 mph (93 km/h). Unlike single thunderstorms, derechos form within mesoscale convective systems (MCS)â€”large storm clusters that produce strong, long-lasting straight-line winds.

  **Conditions that help a derecho form include:**
  * **Strong instability** (Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) over 2000-4000 J/kg): This provides energy for strong updrafts and intense thunderstorms.
  * **High low-level moisture** (dew points of 65-75Â°F): This keeps storms going by supplying moisture.
  * **Strong mid- and upper-level winds** (wind shear over 40 knots): This helps organize storms and push them forward.
  * **A well-defined cold pool**: Rain-cooled air at the surface strengthens the storm by increasing wind speeds at the front of the system.
  </Prose>

  <Prose>
  **Where and when do derechos occur?**

  Derechos happen most often in the central and eastern U.S., especially in the Corn Belt, where the conditions for strong storms are most common. They can also occur in the Southeast and, less often, in the Northeast (Figure 1). Some research suggests that derechos could become more frequent or intense due to rising temperatures, which increase atmospheric instability and change storm patterns. However, scientists are still studying long-term trends.

  ## Detecting Derechos
  There are two main ways to identify derechosâ€”by using Doppler radar and satellite images.

  On Doppler radar, derechos usually have a bow echo shape, which looks like a curved or arched line of storms (Video 2). Key radar features include:
  * **Intense reflectivity along the leading edge**: Shows the strongest storms and heaviest rain.
  * **Rear-inflow jet (RIJ) signatures**: Strong mid-level winds that reach the surface, adding to the stormâ€™s power.
  * **Gust front propagation**: A boundary of cool air ahead of the storm that creates intense winds.
  * **Embedded mesovortices**: Small areas of rotation inside the storm, which can sometimes lead to tornadoes.

  Satellite images help scientists better understand how derechos form and develop. Important satellite features include:
  * **Overshooting tops in infrared (IR) images**: Show areas of extremely strong thunderstorms (Video 3).
  * **Expanding anvil clouds**: Indicate that the storm is growing and lasting longer.
  * **Cold cloud tops (~-70Â°C)**: Reveal powerful updrafts that push storm clouds high into the atmosphere, reaching the tropopause (the boundary between the lower and upper atmosphere).
  * **Dust transport seen in GOES satellite images**: Derechos can lift large amounts of dust into the air, reducing visibility. In some cases, this creates a haboob, an intense dust storm.

  ## May 12, 2022 Northern Plains Derecho - Case Study
  The May 12, 2022, derecho was very intense, producing widespread wind gusts of 80-100 mph across Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa, with some gusts exceeding 105 mph. The event was also unique in that it was classified as a "hot serial derecho", meaning it developed in an environment characterized by extreme heat, instability, and formed along a longer line of storms (Figure 2). With extreme CAPE at about 5000 J/kg, the presence of very unstable air allowed for intense updrafts, fueling deep convection. Similarly, surface temperatures reached 90-100Â°F in some areas, allowing dry air from aloft to mix down and enhance wind speeds. A powerful low-level jet helped accelerate storm movement, leading to widespread high winds. Storms initiated along a sharp dryline, with a trailing cold front reinforcing the storm organization. This derecho was particularly destructive due to the sheer extent of high winds, with a large swath of 80+ mph gusts and an embedded tornado outbreak.

  ### Drought Conditions Prior to Derecho Formation

  Before the May 12, 2022, derecho, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed that the Great Plains was experiencing severe to extreme drought, with the worst conditions in central Nebraska. The NLDAS2 daily topsoil moisture data (shown in the gif below) reveals that these drought conditions had been present since April 1, 2022, lasting for over a month before the storm. With very low soil moisture, crops like corn and soybeans were likely more vulnerable to damage from the high winds and hail that this powerful derecho brought to the region.

  ### Nebraska

  #### ***The First Derecho Forms***
    
  At 2:50 PM on May 12, 2022, the derecho began in southern Nebraska, where severe thunderstorms quickly formed and organized into a fast moving line. As the storm moved northeast, it became even stronger, producing widespread straight line winds of 60 to 80 mph. Some areas, like Hartington, Nebraska, experienced gusts up to 100 mph. 

  The stormâ€™s intensity was clear from the damage it caused. A 300 foot 911 cell tower was completely twisted and mangled, as seen in satellite images, showing the power of the derechoâ€™s winds

  MAXAR WorldView4 satellite imagery helps track storm impacts by providing high resolution satellite images with a 31 cm panchromatic resolution and 1.24 m multispectral resolution. This level of detail allows scientists to monitor changes in vegetation, soil, and infrastructure before and after the storm with greater precision. Unlike lower resolution satellites like MODIS, WorldView4 can capture wind damaged crop rows, fallen trees, and areas of soil erosion in much finer detail, offering a clearer picture of storm related damage.

  ### Nebraska

  #### ***Dry Topsoil Becomes Airborne***

  The extreme winds from the derecho didnâ€™t just damage infrastructure; they also carried massive amounts of aerosol particles, creating a haboob (an intense dust storm). This was especially severe because the ongoing drought had dried out the soil, making it easy for the wind to lift and blow topsoil off farm fields.

  ### MERRA2 Dataset

  #### ***Visualization of Airborne Dust Particles***

  As seen in the MERRA2 Total Aerosol Scattering AOT gif below, the first derecho moved into South Dakota from Nebraska, carrying large amounts of dust into North Dakota and Minnesota. The second derecho, which followed later, moved into northwestern Iowa before continuing into Minnesota.Since this was a serial derecho, MERRA2 satellite imagery helps track the movement of dust from both storm systems. It also provides a regional view, showing how aerosol particles traveled far beyond the immediate storm path. This is especially useful when cloud cover makes it hard to see the dust with the naked eye.

  *Insert MERRA2 timeseries gif of dust transportation here*

  The MERRA2 basemap data shows that northeastern Nebraska had a higher concentration of aerosols compared to the rest of the state. This dust transport led to near zero visibility in many rural areas, making travel dangerous for motorists caught on the roads. The strong winds also stripped topsoil from farmland, causing further damage to crops and soil health.

  ### South Dakota

  #### ***Highest Wind Gusts Recorded During the Derecho***
    
  By 4:10 PM, as the derecho moved into South Dakota, it remained extremely powerful and caused major destruction in nearby cities. Wind speeds of 97â€“107 mph were recorded, heavily damaging areas like Tripp and Dell Rapids, South Dakota. The highest wind gusts were concentrated over Dell Rapids, as shown in the basemap data imagery. This was devastating for farmers who rely on grain silos to store their harvested crops. The storm damaged or destroyed many storage facilities, leading to huge economic losses. Some farmers lost their ability to store grain, forcing them to find emergency storage or risk their harvest spoiling before it could be sold.

  ### South Dakota

  #### ***Powerlines Topple Over from Winds***
    
  The intense winds from the derecho didnâ€™t just damage farmsâ€”it also caused widespread power outages in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

  To track these outages, VIIRS/NPP Night Lights data captured images before and after the storm to show where power was lost. Unlike traditional outage reports that rely on self reporting or utility records, VIIRS provides a clear and wide area view of electricity disruptions.

  ### South Dakota

  #### ***Tornados Begin to Form***
   
  In Castlewood, South Dakota, the strongest tornado of the dayâ€”a EF2 tornadoâ€”tore through the town, destroying homes, barns, and grain bins, along with intense straight line winds. The town suffered widespread power outages and structural collapse, as shown in the images below. The National Weather Service Damage Assessment Toolkit recorded the tornadoâ€™s path as it cut through the center of the city, leaving behind severe damage. Farmers faced major challenges in the aftermath. The strong winds and tornado scattered debris across agricultural fields, making recovery even harder. Between the high wind gusts and widespread destruction, rebuilding efforts took time and resources.

  ### Iowa

  #### ***A Second Derecho Forms and Enters State lines***

  Because of the massive size of this storm, a second derecho reached northwestern Iowa by 5:30 PM, even as it continued to batter South Dakota. Although only one brief tornado was reported with minimal damage, most of the destruction came from the straight line winds. Wind gusts of 70 to 90 mph knocked down power lines and caused major damage to farm buildings, affecting both crops and livestock facilities.

  The derechoâ€™s powerful winds lifted large amounts of dust, particulate matter (PM), and debris into the air, creating hazardous air conditions across the region. MERRA2 imagery showed a spike in aerosol levels in northwestern Iowa, with dust and particles traveling hundreds of miles. This significantly worsened air quality far beyond the stormâ€™s path.

  ### Minnesota

  #### ***Straight line Winds Batter Infastructure***

  Upon entering Minnesota at 6:10 pm, the storm moved across the state with remarkable speed, leaving a swath of damage in its wake. This brought about more extreme winds, large hail, and multiple tornadoes. The strongest wind gusts, reaching 94 mph, were recorded in Madison, Minnesota. Farmers reported significant crop losses due to wind driven hail and excessive rainfall in some areas. According to the National Weather Service in Twin Cities, several farm buildings were destroyed, and widespread debris littered the countryside, impacting livestock and agricultural operations.

  ### North Dakota

  #### ***Heavy Rain and Wind Gusts Persist***
  
  Although North Dakota was on the northern edge of the derecho's path, the state still experienced strong wind gusts over 75 mph, along with isolated tornadoes and hail by 7:10 PM. The high winds caused damage to power infrastructure and buildings, while some rural areas reported crop losses due to wind driven erosion and flooding. The Grand Forks National Weather Service documented widespread tree damage and structural impacts in the Red River Valley. Farmers in the affected areas faced soil erosion and planting delays, making recovery even more challenging.

  ## Community Consequences and Emergency Response
  The May 12, 2022, derecho had a devastating impact on rural communities, showing how vulnerable they are to extreme weather. The agriculture sector was hit hardest, with corn and soybean fieldsâ€”a major part of the regionâ€™s economyâ€”flattened within minutes. 

  Data from the USDA crop distribution map and storm reports show that the derechoâ€™s strongest winds, hail, and tornadoes directly hit some of the most important farming areas in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota (Figure 4). Wind gusts over 100 mph (similar to the strength of a weak hurricane) caused widespread lodging (where corn stalks are bent or broken by the wind), while hail shredded plant leaves and bruised crops, reducing harvest quality and yield. Many grain silos, irrigation systems, and farm buildings were also damaged or destroyed, adding to the financial burden on farmers.

  Beyond farms, the economic impact spread further. Even when grain silos werenâ€™t completely destroyed, many lost power, making it impossible to ventilate and store grain properly. Despite community efforts to clear roads and restore power, the recovery process was slow and difficult, exposing the challenges rural areas face after such a disaster.

  The derecho also tested the effectiveness of emergency response systems. While early warnings helped some residents prepare, the storm moved so quickly and with such intensity that many were caught off guard. Emergency responders struggled to reach damaged areas due to blocked roads, power outages, and a second round of storms that followed. With so much destruction, the South Dakota governor declared a state of emergency for 20 counties, allowing more resources to be used for disaster relief and recovery efforts.

  ## Conclusion and Future Outlook
  Looking ahead, derechos like this one could become more frequent and intense due to climate extremes. As global temperatures rise, the atmosphere becomes more unstable and holds more moisture, creating better conditions for severe storms. If this trend continues, stronger derechos could become more common, increasing the risk of destruction in rural communities.

  For farmers, the impacts of a derecho donâ€™t end after the storm. The immediate damage to crops, grain silos, and irrigation systems is devastating, but the long-term effects can be even worse. Soil erosion, caused by high winds and heavy rain, can reduce land productivity, making it harder to grow crops in the future. Farmers also face financial struggles due to lost harvests, damaged equipment, and the rising cost of repairs and rebuilding.

  To reduce future damage, communities must focus on stronger infrastructure, better forecasting, and improved emergency plans. Rural areas could benefit from more wind-resistant buildings, upgraded power systems, and better storm shelters. Government programs will also need to provide financial aid and disaster relief to help farmers recover faster.

  As extreme weather events become more common, taking action now is crucial. Protecting farmland, improving emergency preparedness, and strengthening infrastructure are not just important for farmersâ€”they are necessary for keeping local economies stable. By investing in resilience, communities can better protect themselves from future disasters and reduce the impact of derechos in the years to come.
