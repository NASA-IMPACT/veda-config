    ## Overview
    The morning of May 12, 2022, began quietly across the Midwest, but by midday, the skies darkened as a powerful serial derecho brought hurricane-force winds exceeding 100 mph across Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. With 68 reports of wind gusts over 75 mph, this weather event proved to be destructive as it impacted the Northern Plains region. These states are deeply rooted in agriculture, where farming is a good portion of their economies, serving as a source of employment in farming, processing, and distribution, and producing key crops like corn and soybeans (figure 1). Therefore, severe weather events like derechos pose a significant threat to these livelihoods, causing crop destruction, soil erosion, and damage to critical infrastructure such as grain silos and irrigation systems. When farms are impacted, the ripple effects extend beyond these small communities, disrupting local economies, and food supply chains.

  ## Datatsets Utilized
  In this story, impacts can be seen in analyzing several datasets that capture its physical, economic, and societal consequences. [GOES Satellite](https://www.noaasis.noaa.gov/GOES/goes_overview.html) and [NEXRAD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar/next-generation-weather-radar) radar imagery illustrate the derecho‚Äôs bow-shaped structure that produces damaging straight line winds and overshooting cloud tops that demonstrate the updrafts capable of intense convection occurring in the atmosphere. Similarly, [NWS storm reports](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/faq.jsp) detail tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts that added to the damage. [Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/) data highlight the extensive damage to farmland and vegetation, coupled with [USDA crop price](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Agricultural_Prices/index.php) data to identify if prices increased due to crop destruction and [IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) precipitation data quantifying the heavy rainfall that contributed to soil erosion and flooding. [Black Marble Night Lights](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/) data show widespread power outages, particularly in rural areas that may cause recovery slowdowns. Lastly, [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/merra-2/) data track dust and aerosols transported by the storm, illustrating degraded air quality that exacerbates respiratory health issues that individuals have. Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of the storm's far-reaching impacts on the Northern Plains.

    ## What is a Derecho?
    Derechos are a type of severe windstorm caused by thunderstorms that move quickly in a straight line over a wide area. Unlike tornadoes, which have rotating winds, derechos produce widespread, powerful straight-line winds that can extend for hundreds of miles. The May 12, 2022, event was a serial derecho, a particularly intense storm that occurs when multiple clusters of thunderstorms form along a cold front, creating a prolonged impact on the same region (figure 2). This is especially destructive because it produces multiple rounds of high winds over an extended area, weakening structures with each storm that moves through.

    The atmospheric setup created the perfect conditions for the destructive derecho. A significant heatwave gripped the region, with temperatures in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, reaching an unseasonable 94¬∞F, fueling instability for storms to form. Coupled with high moisture levels, a robust low-pressure system over the Plains, and a powerful jet stream enhancing wind shear, thunderstorms intensified and organized into a massive ‚Äúbow-shaped‚Äù complex. The combination described provided all the necessary ingredients for the storm's rapid development and widespread destruction on farmland and infrastructure.

    ## Broader Severe Weather Impacts
   Not only was this derecho damaging in itself, but it was accompanied by a series of secondary severe weather events, including tornadoes and hail. South Dakota experienced 14 tornadoes, with an EF2 near Gary causing significant structural damage. Hailstones as large as golf balls battered vehicles and homes, while flash flooding overwhelmed drainage systems in urban areas. Information from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) details the secondary events by state, underscoring the derecho‚Äôs role in compounding weather disasters. For residents and emergency responders, these additional challenges strained resources and delayed recovery efforts.

    For farmers, the derecho meant not only immediate financial loss but also long-term challenges, as topsoil erosion caused by high winds further reduced the land‚Äôs productivity for future crops. Reports from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) detailed significant disruptions to planting and harvest cycles, while the market data provided show a sharp spike in the prices of corn and soybeans. The month of June 2022 demonstrated the immediate impacts just two weeks following the event with its highest prices for these crops, with corn at $7.38 U.S. dollars per bushel and soybeans at $16.40. These fluctuations reflected concerns over reduced supply, directly tied to the damage inflicted on key agricultural states.

    ## Aerosol and Dust Transport
    The derecho‚Äôs intense winds lifted substantial amounts of dust, particulate matter (PM), and debris into the atmosphere which led to hazardous air conditions across the region. MERRA imagery captured an increase in aerosols seen after the event, which traveled hundreds of miles, significantly degrading air quality far beyond the storm‚Äôs path. 
  </Prose>
</Block>

<Block>
  <Prose>
    Research shows that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) generated during such events can exacerbate health conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and cardiovascular diseases. This is directly linked to the fact that hospitals across South Dakota and Iowa reported an increase in respiratory-related hospital visits, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health conditions. Studies have linked these airborne particulates to increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the respiratory system, further amplifying health risks for affected communities. The derecho‚Äôs environmental and health impacts highlight the far-reaching consequences of severe weather events on public health and air quality.

    ## Community Consequences
   Beyond the fields, the derecho wreaked havoc on rural infrastructure and communities. Nightlight data from NASA revealed the extent of power outages, with entire counties plunged into darkness for days. For residents reliant on electricity for irrigation, food storage, and daily life, these outages amplified the disaster‚Äôs impacts. Data from PowerOutage.us showed over 1 million customers lost power across the affected states, with some outages lasting more than a week. The disruption to electricity worsened economic losses, as grain silos requiring power for ventilation and storage were rendered inoperable, even if it wasn‚Äôt directly damaged by the wind gusts.
  
   Economically, the storm caused ripple effects. Damage to grain storage facilities not only affected individual farmers but also had overflowing effects on local markets, leading to increased prices for consumers. Stories of resilience emerged as neighbors worked together to clear roads and restore power, but the recovery underscored the challenges rural communities face in rebuilding after such disasters.

    ## Emergency Results and Recovery
   This particular storm system highlighted both the strengths and weaknesses of current emergency response systems. While early warning systems provided some residents with time to prepare, the rapid speed and intensity of the derecho left many caught off guard. Emergency responders faced challenges accessing damaged areas due to blocked roads and power outages, delaying relief efforts.
  
   Improving community resilience against such events involves enhancing early-warning communication systems and reinforcing infrastructure. In rural areas, investing in more robust power grids and shelters can help mitigate the effects of future derechos. Education and preparedness campaigns are also crucial in ensuring that residents understand the risks associated with derechos and know how to respond accordingly. Aid programs from state and federal agencies offered some relief to farmers, but rebuilding remained a large and daunting task. Many residents called for increased investment in resilient infrastructure to alleviate the impacts of future extreme weather events.

    ## Impacts and Implications
   The May 12, 2022, derecho was a harsh reminder of the Midwest‚Äôs vulnerability to extreme weather, highlighting its devastating impacts on farmland, rural communities, and the regional economy. For farmers, the destruction of crops, grain silos, and irrigation systems is immediate, but the long-term challenges of soil erosion and reduced land productivity pose even greater risks. Rural communities reliant on agriculture face prolonged disruptions to livelihoods and local economies, with rebuilding efforts further strained by the rising cost of infrastructure repairs.
  
   In a warmer climate, the frequency and intensity of derechos could increase, as higher temperatures enhance atmospheric instability and moisture content, presenting an urgent need for adaptation. Investments in wind-resistant infrastructure and sustainable farming practices will be critical to reducing future impacts. As extreme weather events become more common, building resilience is not only necessary for protecting farmland and communities but also vital for ensuring the stability of the broader economy in an era of climate extremes.
