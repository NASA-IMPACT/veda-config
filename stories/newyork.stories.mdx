        <p>In cities across the United States, there’s more in the air than meets the eye. Pollutants in the atmosphere travel, don’t respect borders, and can take many forms – from microscopic particles to large plumes of greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>In New York City, tracking human-caused emissions – understanding where they come from and where they’re going – involves a community. Pilots, satellite builders, modeling experts, students, city leaders, and residents work to help the city achieve its 2050 carbon neutral target date.</p>
        <p>At the center of the effort is Róisín Commane, an atmospheric chemist with Columbia University. Commane is an investigator, scouring the city from surface to sky looking for unidentified or incorrectly cataloged sources of greenhouse gases, from old wastewater treatment plants to covered landfills.</p>
        <p>This part of Commane’s work is supported by the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA), NOAA, and the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center). A big goal: improve city-level emissions estimates by combining measurements from a network of sensors across New York City with NASA satellite and airborne data. This combination of measurements increases understanding of human-caused emissions and advances the models used to estimate them.</p>
        <p>Commane is interested in the interactions between city greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The burning of fossil fuels, primarily for power generation and via vehicles, releases both greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants.</p>
        <p>She’s been working to measure both in New York City since 2019. Her team has set up a network of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane sensors around the New York City area. She’s also hit the road, measuring sources on the ground using portable sensors and drones.</p>

        <p>Over the years, Commane and her collaborators have reported some interesting findings.</p>
        <p>Although New York is the most densely populated city in the U.S., it also has the most trees (an estimated 7 million). These trees absorb a large amount of carbon in the summer, reducing overall greenhouse gas levels for the city. However, some types of oak tree emit natural chemicals that can react with the pollution from cars and buildings. This produces ground-level ozone, or smog, which is toxic to humans. Many of the models used to estimate emissions for cities do not account for the role of vegetation in linking air quality and the carbon cycle.</p>
        <p>They also found that, like many communities, New York City saw a drop in nitrogen oxide emissions, another contributor to smog, due to reduced vehicle traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also tracked a drop in carbon monoxide – a common byproduct of idling vehicles and incomplete combustion. Though levels still appeared higher than many would have estimated.</p>

    ## New York City and Beyond
    <p>Globally, urban areas are responsible for an estimated 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. While New York City is one of the nation’s leading carbon emitters, a version of this story plays out in every community in America. In Chicago and Los Angeles, tailpipe emissions spew from congested streets. In Phoenix, record-breaking heat stokes ozone formation. In port cities like Baltimore and Houston, emissions from ships, as well as oil refineries and chemical plants, contribute to air quality issues.</p>
    <p>However, cities are uniquely positioned to reduce emissions while benefiting the health of their citizens, Commane says. The US GHG Center offers information, tools, and data to support city leaders to make informed policy decisions.</p>
    <p>“If we want to make a difference, we need a two-way conversation with cities and towns to understand what information they need,” Commane said. “Cities get stuff done.”</p>
    <p>“We need as much data as we can get,” said Ellen Burkhard, a senior advisor in NYSERDA’s Environmental Research Program who works closely with Commane. “It’s a cliché, but you can’t manage what you don’t measure.”</p>
    <p>Commane noted the unprecedented amount of open data currently available. Case in point: last summer’s NASA-led mission that included a fleet of aircraft, laboratories on wheels, weather balloons, and hundreds of scientists mobilizing to track gases and other air pollutants in unprecedented detail.</p>
    <p>That mission, called Synergistic TEMPO Air Quality Science ([STAQS](https://espo.nasa.gov/staqs/content/STAQS)), honed in on several North American population centers: New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Toronto. The goal was to map gases and other air pollutants from the ground up through the [troposphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/), the lowest and largest layer of Earth’s atmosphere, in order to track where they come from and how they change hour by hour, and identify neighborhoods disproportionately exposed to unhealthy air.</p>

    <p>And while their team is currently working through the findings from New York, what they learn can be applied in other communities to more accurately estimate emissions and improve efforts to reduce them.</p>
    <p>“The lessons we learn from New York will have an immediate impact on tens of millions of people living locally but can be applied everywhere,” Commane said. “If we can do it in New York, we can do it anywhere.”</p>
    <p>“It’s all hands on deck,” said Burkhard.</p>
