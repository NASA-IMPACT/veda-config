  ## The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)
  NLDAS is a widely-used land modeling environment that generates estimates of land surface fluxes and states such as soil moisture, snow, and streamflow. These estimates are critical for drought and flood monitoring, water availability and water resource management, climate assessments, and other uses. For instance, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) relies on NLDAS data for their drought assessments. Applications like [OpenET](https://etdata.org/) and [QuickDRI](https://quickdri.unl.edu/) also rely on the quality of NLDAS meteorological forcing and model outputs. The phase 2 of NLDAS (NLDAS-2) is currently operational at NOAA, with long-term archives of data back to Jan 1979 available from NASA.

  ## Community-Centered Model Development
  Building on stakeholder feedback and advancements in Earth observations and data assimilation, teams across NASA are working on major enhancements to the NLDAS environment called “NLDAS Phase 3” (NLDAS-3). The vision for NLDAS-3 is to provide near field scale (~1 km), high quality, observation-informed estimates of land surface and hydrology conditions.  Specifically, NLDAS-3 aims to:   
  - Improve the spatial resolution by providing meteorological forcing and land-surface model output at 1-km resolution;
  - Expand the spatial coverage to encompass all of North and Central America (including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico);  
  - Utilize high quality surface meteorological data;
  - Reduce the current NLDAS-2 latency of 3.5 days to near real-time; 
  - Upgrade the land surface model to include the latest scientific advancements, such as improved representation of groundwater processes (He et al., 2023); and
  - Incorporate observational constraints by assimilating remote sensing datasets, which can help capture human management of water and vegetation, such as irrigation, groundwater withdrawal, droughts, floods, and hydrological impacts of wildland fire and other disturbances

  To make these improvements, science and modeling teams across NASA centers are using the open source NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework (Kumar et al., 2006; Peters-Lidard et al., 2007), a state-of-the-art software suite for high performance terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation. LIS software is open-source and available at [GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF).

  ## Precipitation and Meteorology Data Updates
  NASA is updating NLDAS surface meteorology by leveraging NASA’s reanalysis and remote sensing data products. Specifically, we are working on a new data assimilation approach used successfully in operational environments as well as advanced optimal interpolation techniques (Kemp et al. 2022) to blend well-known and widely used meteorological datasets. Daily precipitation amounts at 4 km of the NASA Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; Huffman et al. 2020) and the ECCC Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA; Lespinas et al. 2015) are assimilated into NASA Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2; Gelaro et al. 2017) precipitation data. Then the precipitation analysis at 4 km is downscaled to a 1 km fine-scale resolution using a cloud cover frequency-based algorithm and disaggregated into hourly using IMERG and MERRA-2 datasets. Below is a sample of NLDAS-3 precipitation data compared to NLDAS-2 over the U.S. Midwest region to illustrate improved spatial resolution. 
  The other meteorological forcings are obtained by downscaling MERRA-2 datasets (except for Shortwave Down radiation, which will use CERES/POWER data) using the methods as follows:
