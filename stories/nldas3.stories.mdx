  ## Introduction
  <mark>ðŸš§ This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! ðŸš§</mark>

  The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) is a widely used land modeling environment with a surface forcing analysis driving multiple land-surface models (LSMs). Phase 2 of the NLDAS project (NLDAS-2) is operational at NOAA and has a wide user-base (more than 5000 unique users every year based on the data access metrics from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (NASA GES DISC). The current system is used by numerous stakeholders and science groups for applications ranging from drought and flood monitoring, water availability and resource management, and climate assessment, among others. Estimates of land surface fluxes and states such as soil moisture, snow, and groundwater are often used by the users to support these applications. 
  
  Many downstream and value-added data products rely on the quality of NLDAS-2 forcing and model outputs. With feedback from the stakeholder community and improvements in Earth observation data assimilation capabilities (from NASA satellites, models, and other remote sensing observations), the NASA SPoRT and EIS teams are working to improve data quality by addressing known issues, enabling finer spatial scale estimates, and expanding the domain. This new environment is called NLDAS Phase 3 (NLDAS-3). 
  
  The vision of NLDAS-3 is to provide near field scale (~1km), high quality, observation-informed estimates of land surface and hydrology conditions, intended to support the needs for scientific research and water resources applications. Specifically, NLDAS-3 will reduce the current latency of 3.5 days to true real-time, upgrade the land surface model to match the latest advancements in the research community, incorporate observational constraints by assimilating terrestrial hydrological remote sensing datasets, expand the geographical coverage to encompass all of North and Central America, and utilize high quality surface meteorological data. The integration of remote sensing data is crucial for accurately depicting the influence of human activities on the land surface, such as agricultural irrigation, groundwater extraction, reservoir management, and wildfires.

  NLDAS-3 uses the following precipitation datasets: 1) daily precipitation gauge observations; 2) the NASA Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) half-hourly retrospective and real-time precipitation retrievals; 3) data from the NASA Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System for Instrument Teams (GEOS-IT); and 4) ECCC Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) retrospective and real-time precipitation analyses. We assimilated daily precipitation amounts at 4 km of IMERG and CaPA into the MERRA-2 (GEOS-IT for real-time analyses) precipitation using an optimal interpolation technique based on residual kriging and the Bratseth algorithm. Then the precipitation analysis at 4 km was (1) downscaled to 1-km grid spacing using a cloud cover frequency-based algorithm and (2) disaggregated into hourly using IMERG and MERRA-2 datasets.

  ## Examples of known Issues in the current NLDAS-2 system
  There have been numerous instances of recurring/persistent dry bulls-eyes in precipitation and soil moisture from QC issues in the daily gauge analysis (see figure below).

  Also, the precipitation interpolation scheme of the daily gauge analysis changed on 1 January 2012.  The change of the interpolation scheme has affected soil moisture climatologies, resulting in unrealistic patterns, particularly apparent in the intermountain West and along the U.S.-Mexico border (see figure below).

    ### Section for scrollytelling
    Furthermore, there are cross-border (U.S.-Canada) precipitation issues related to the blending scheme between different precipitation inputs; some years are abnormally dry, and some years are abnormally wet, particularly in southern Ontario and Quebec (see figure below).

    ### NLDAS-3 sample precipitation:
    The other surface meteorological variables will also be downscaled to 1-km:
    - Surface pressure and longwave down adjusted using 1-km surface topography, using a similar methodology to NLDAS-2.
    - Temperature and moisture adjustments using a dynamic lapse rate methodology currently being implemented/evaluated.
    - Winds adjusted using MicroMet methodology, which uses values of computed topographic slope, topographic slope azimuth, and topographic curvature.
    - Shortwave down using data from CERES/POWER data, and then downscaled using slope-aspect correction using 1-km topography.
