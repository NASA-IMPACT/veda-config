  ## The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)
  NLDAS is a widely-used land modeling environment that generates estimates of land surface fluxes and states such as soil moisture, snow, and streamflow. These estimates are critical for drought and flood monitoring, water availability and water resource management, climate assessments, and other uses. For instance, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) relies on NLDAS data for their drought assessments. Applications like [OpenET](https://etdata.org/) and [QuickDRI](https://quickdri.unl.edu/) also rely on the quality of NLDAS meteorological forcing and model outputs. The phase 2 of NLDAS (NLDAS-2) is currently operational at NOAA.

  ## Community-Centered Model Development
  Building on stakeholder feedback and advancements in Earth observations and data assimilation, teams across NASA are working on major enhancements to the NLDAS environment called “NLDAS Phase 3” (NLDAS-3). The vision for NLDAS-3 is to provide near field scale (~1 km), high quality, observation-informed estimates of land surface and hydrology conditions.  Specifically, NLDAS-3 aims to:   
  - Improve the spatial resolution of NLDAS-2 by providing meteorological forcing and land-surface model output at 1-km resolution;
  - Expand the geographical coverage to encompass all of North and Central America; 
  - Utilize high quality surface meteorological data;
  - Reduce the current NLDAS-2 latency of 3.5 days to near real-time; 
  - Upgrade the land surface model to include the latest scientific advancements, such as improved representation of groundwater processes and energy balance budget (He et al., 2023); and
  - Incorporate observational constraints by assimilating remote sensing datasets.

  **Summary of NLDAS-3 improvements**

  ## Modeling and Data Enhancement in NLDAS-3
  The team is using the open source NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework (Kumar et al., 2006; Peters-Lidard et al., 2007), a state-of-the-art software suite for high performance terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation. LIS development is led by the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The LIS software is open-source and available at [GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF).

  NLDAS-3 will employ the Noah-MP land surface model (He et al., 2023), implemented within LIS. Schematics of the energy and water budgets and processes represented in the model are shown below.

  **Integrating remote sensing data is crucial for accurately depicting the influence of human activities on the land surface, such as agricultural irrigation, groundwater extraction, reservoir management, and wildfires.** To better detect these impacts, we are working to assimilate the following NASA satellite data products in NLDAS-3:
  
  The multivariate assimilation (also known as reanalysis) will produce land (e.g., vegetation states, evapotranspiration, snow dynamics) and hydrologic (soil moisture, groundwater and surface water storage) variables listed below at a spatial resolution of 1 km.
  Data will be provided in netCDF-4 format through NASA’s open source cloud environments.  Based on the needs of the stakeholder community, a collection of selected variables will also be made available in formats such as cloud-optimized GEOTIFF and GIS-based, among others.
