  ## Introduction
  **The North American Land Data Assimilation System** (NLDAS) is a widely-used land modeling environment that generates estimates of land surface fluxes and states such as soil moisture, snow, and streamflow for drought and flood monitoring, water availability and water resource management, climate assessments, and other uses (see responses from the 2023 stakeholder workshop on uses in Figure 1 below). NLDAS-2 has a wide user-base (more than 6000 unique users every year based on data access metrics from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center [(NASA GES DISC)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?keywords=NLDAS).

  ## How is NLDAS Data Used?
  The University of Nebraska-Lincoln‚Äôs National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) uses NLDAS data provided by NASA SPoRT-LIS as inputs to the U.S. Drought Monitor‚Äôs current condition maps, including groundwater storage, surface soil moisture, and root zone soil moisture products.

  </Figure>
  Other downstream and value-added data applications such as OpenET and QuickDRI rely on the quality of NLDAS-2 meteorological forcing and model outputs, so NASA is continually investing in research and technology advancements to upgrade this modeling system based on feedback from the community. For example, NLDAS developers as well as system users have reported issues such as recurring or persistent dry bulls-eyes in precipitation and soil moisture from the daily gauge analysis, soil moisture climatology issues from changes in the precipitation interpolation scheme, and cross-border precipitation issues related to the blending scheme (see figure X below). These issues and proposed solutions are discussed online in the [NLDAS FAQ](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/faq/nldas) and in community discussion forums and meetings.

  ## Meeting the Needs of NLDAS Partners and Stakeholders
  With feedback from the stakeholder community and improvements in Earth observation data assimilation capabilities from NASA satellites, models, and other observations, NASA SPoRT, LIS, and EIS teams are developing a new system that resolves these known issues and improves data quality and access in a number of ways. This new land and water modeling environment is called NLDAS Phase 3 (NLDAS-3). 

  The vision of NLDAS-3 is to provide near field scale (~1km), high quality, observation-informed estimates of land surface and hydrology conditions to support the needs of water resources managers, the agricultural community, climate impact assessments, drought and flood disaster monitoring and resilience efforts, as well as for scientific research. Specifically, NLDAS-3 will reduce the current NLDAS-2 latency of 3.5 days to true real-time, upgrade the land surface model to match the latest scientific advancements, incorporate observational constraints by assimilating terrestrial hydrological remote sensing datasets, expand the geographical coverage to encompass all of North and Central America, and utilize high quality surface meteorological data. The integration of remote sensing data is crucial for accurately depicting the influence of human activities on the land surface, such as agricultural irrigation, groundwater extraction, reservoir management, and wildfires. Below is a summary of improvements the modeling team is working on:
  
  ## Using NASA precipitation and meteorology forcing data
  To accommodate the expanded spatial domain, to support the finer spatial scales, and to take advantage of advances in precipitation analyses, NLDAS-3 will use the following precipitation datasets: 1) daily precipitation gauge observations over North America; 2) the NASA Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; (Huffman et al. 2020)) half-hourly retrospective and real-time precipitation retrievals; 3) data from the NASA Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2; (Gelaro et al. 2017)) and the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System for Instrument Teams (GEOS-IT); and 4) ECCC Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA; (Lespinas et al. 2015)) retrospective and real-time precipitation analyses. We assimilate daily precipitation amounts at 4 km of IMERG and CaPA into the MERRA-2 (GEOS-IT for real-time analyses) precipitation using an optimal interpolation technique based on residual kriging and the Bratseth algorithm. Then the precipitation analysis at 4 km is: (1) downscaled to a fine-scale resolution using a cloud cover frequency-based algorithm and (2) disaggregated into hourly using IMERG and MERRA-2 datasets.

  Improvements to meteorological forcings are summarized below:

  The goal is to provide near real-time and retrospective data depending on the needs of stakeholders as well as limitations in source data time extents. The starting year of the dataset is under discussion with the data user community; options are to start at 1980 with the start of the MERRA-2/ CaPA data or at 2002 when many remotely-sensed data assimilation products begin.
 
  NLDAS-3 will use a new data assimilation approach to precipitation blending called ‚ÄúA NASA-Air Force Precipitation Analysis‚Äù or NAFPA, a new precipitation algorithm developed at NASA for the United States Air Force (Kemp et al., 2022). NLDAS-3 will use advanced optimal interpolation techniques to blend well-known and widely used meteorological datasets. A daily 4-km analysis will be downscaled to hourly using IMERG, and then the AIST-CAPRI application is used to get to 1-km.

  Other surface meteorological variables will also be downscaled to 1-km as follows:
  - Surface pressure and longwave down adjusted using 1-km surface topography, using similar methodology to NLDAS-2.
  - Temperature and moisture adjustments using a dynamic lapse rate methodology.
  - Winds adjusted using MicroMet methodology, which uses values of computed topographic slope, topographic slope azimuth, and topographic curvature.
  - Shortwave down using data from NASA CERES/POWER data (Rutan et al. 2015), and then downscaled using slope-aspect correction using 1-km topography.

  Using NASA Land Information System and a New Land Surface Model, Noah-MP. 
  The modeling team is using the NASA Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al., 2006; Peters-Lidard et al., 2007) as the flexible framework for integrating different modeling components and to accomplish data assimilation (DA) of NASA Earth observations such as soil moisture, snow, terrestrial water storage (TWS), and vegetation.

  The Land Information System (LIS) is a software framework for high performance terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation developed with the goal of integrating satellite and ground-based observational data products and advanced modeling techniques to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes.  The LIS development is led by the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.  The LIS software is open-source and available at GitHub.

  The Noah-MP Land Surface Model (LSM) (He et al., 2023; see Technical document link below), managed by NCAR, is a state of the art land surface model used in several other Earth modeling systems (NWM, WRF, UFS, LIS, etc.). It contains advanced physics, including 3-layer snow physics, separate ground and canopy energy/water balance calculations, and numerous physics options including groundwater and prognostic phenology. A schematic of the variables used in the model is included as Figure 5 below.

  For NLDAS-3, we will use Noah-MP physics options for groundwater and for prognostic phenology and we will assimilate the following remotely-sensed satellite data products:
  - Soil moisture (SMAP, AMSR-E, AMSR-2)
  - Snow (Passive microwave, optical, potentially machine learning techniques)
  - MODIS/VIIRS 4-day LAI (Leaf Area Index) - to assimilate vegetation information
  - GRACE/GRACE-FO TWS

  Also, the precipitation interpolation scheme of the daily gauge analysis changed on 1 January 2012.  The change of the interpolation scheme has affected soil moisture climatologies, resulting in unrealistic patterns, particularly apparent in the intermountain West and along the U.S.-Mexico border (see figure below).

    Furthermore, there are cross-border (U.S.-Canada) precipitation issues related to the blending scheme between different precipitation inputs; some years are abnormally dry, and some years are abnormally wet, particularly in southern Ontario and Quebec (see figure below).
