   Livestock producers across rural America are facing growing challenges due to the increasing frequency of severe heat and cold events. In states like North Dakota, prolonged cold periods and wind chills place significant stress on cattle, threatening their [health and survival](https://sentientmedia.org/farmers-face-frostbitten-cows-dead-calves-and-harsh-financial-consequences/). Meanwhile, in southern states such as Texas, extended episodes of high daytime and nighttime temperatures push the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) beyond safe levels, leading to heat stress, reduced productivity, and avoidable livestock losses. These challenges have considerable [economic impacts](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events); for instance, winter cold events in the Northern Plains resulted in over $20 million in cattle losses in 2023 alone, while heat stress nationwide causes an estimated $370 million in annual losses to feedlot operations.

     <p>
     The severity of these events became eveident in June 2022, when an intense heat wave swept across Kansas, killing thousands of cattle within days. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment confirmed at least 2,000 [cattle deaths](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105482394/cattle-kansas-heat-wave), though industry estimates suggest the toll could have reached as high as 10,000 head during that single event. Temperatures soared above 100°F with high humidity and little nighttime cooling, creating lethal conditions for the herds. This mass die-off raised urgent questions about the future of America’s $80 billion cattle industry, even in areas once considered less vulnerable. From the ongoing heat stress in southern states to rising cases of [cold stress](https://extension.sdstate.edu/sites/default/files/2021-05/S-0013-08.pdf) and hypothermia during harsh winters in states such as Montana and North Dakota, cattle producers nationwide are navigating evolving challenges. These severe weather events impact both animal welfare and national food security, demanding urgent attention and adaptive solutions across the country.

    ### Managing Temperature Challenges in Livestock
     When weather events such as heatwaves or blizzards occur, human health often takes center stage in the headlines. However, livestock, particularly cattle, face serious consequences from severe temperatures that significantly impact their energy needs and overall well-being. In cold stress conditions, like the harsh winters experienced in states such as North Dakota, cattle must increase their maintenance energy to generate enough body heat to survive temperatures below their lower critical threshold. Conversely, during hot summers in states like Texas and Oklahoma, cattle suffer heat stress when temperatures exceed their upper critical threshold. To understand how heat affects them, we use something called the Temperature Humidity Index (THI), which is similar to the heat index people use to measure how hot it feels.

<Block style={{justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems: 'center', margin: '0 auto', width: '100%' }}>
   <Prose style={{ textAlign: 'justify', flex: '1', alignItems: 'center', marginLeft: '0.2rem'}}>
     <p>
      Cattle operate within a narrow comfort zone called the thermoneutral zone. Cattle operate within a narrow comfort range known as the thermoneutral zone, where energy needs for maintenance are minimal.  In our analysis, we use critical THI thresholds of 75, 82, and 94, representing escalating levels of heat stress (Lee et al., 2025). Think of these as warning levels:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>THI 75:</strong> Cattle begin showing mild stress signs</li>
      <li><strong>THI 82:</strong> Significant physiological stress begins</li>
      <li><strong>THI 94:</strong> Life-threatening conditions emerge</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
Each episode of temperature stress diverts energy away from vital production functions including growth, reproduction, and milk yield. Repeated heat or cold stress events compound these effects, triggering cascading economic losses that ultimately impact consumers through higher [food prices](https://www.agriculture.com/partners-beef-prices-soar-to-record-highs-in-june-11775697).

### Livestock in Harsh Winters
<ul> 
<li><strong>Lack of Acclimation:</strong> The Northern Plains and Midwest experience large fluctuations in temperaturea, leading to unstable thermal conditions that can increase pressure on livestock and complicate herd management.</li> 
<li><strong>Lower Minimum Temperatures:</strong> When temperatures fall below cattle’s lower critical temperature, they must expend more energy to maintain body heat. Wind chill often makes conditions feel even colder, intensifying cold stress risks.</li> 
<li><strong>Blizzard Count and Vulnerability:</strong> Blizzard frequency data confirms that the Dakota have experienced over 100 blizzards since 1950, with many counties averaging one or more blizzards annually. This high blizzard count in the Dakotas significantly increases cold stress challenges for livestock and adds operational risks for producers in these regions.</li>

  ### Climate Drivers: The Slow Aggravators
       While temperature is the primary driver of heat stress in cattle, other climate variables such as vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, and soil moisture also play critical roles. It is not just the average levels of these factors, but their variability that has a greater impact.
### The Role of Drought and Soil Moisture
Soil moisture emerges as a critical but often overlooked factor. When soil moisture is depleted, the land loses its capacity to buffer temperature extremes, creating a feedback loop that makes cattle more vulnerable to combined heat and water scarcity. During the 2022 Kansas heat wave, [SMAP](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/) soil moisture data showed severely depleted conditions across the region, amplifying the heat stress effects on cattle. This combination of drought and heat creates the perfect conditions for mass mortality events.

    <h3>Precipitation Patterns Matter More Than Totals</h3>
    <p>
      In dry states like Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Kansas, it's not total precipitation but its variability (precipitation standard deviation) that most strongly correlates with cattle mortality. High variability whether within a season or between years disrupts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Forage Growth:</strong> Unpredictable rainfall creates feast-or-famine conditions for pasture</li>
      <li><strong>Water Availability:</strong> Inconsistent precipitation affects water source reliability</li>
      <li><strong>Pasture Quality:</strong> Variable moisture creates uneven forage nutrition and availability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This variability makes it nearly impossible for cattle to maintain condition and for producers to plan resources effectively.

  <Prose style={{ textAlign: 'justify', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
     <p>
      ### The Role of Vegetation Health
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides crucial insights into forage quality and vegetation stress. NDVI measures the "greenness" and health of plant cover, low values signal poor or stressed vegetation, directly impacting feed quality and availability for cattle. During heat events, declining NDVI indicates not just immediate stress but also reduced nutritional quality of available forage, compounding the challenges cattle face.

  ### The Landscape of Vulnerability
    <p>
  Understanding where cattle are most vulnerable requires examining how operations align with natural resources and climate patterns. From open rangelands to intensively managed feedlots, the distribution of grassland and pasture shapes where and how cattle are raised.

  ### Pasture: The Forage Base for Cattle
    <p>
    Pasture and grassland provide the primary forage base for cattle in many counties, as shown by the percentage of pasture in each county from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The availability and quality of pasture directly influence the viability of pasture-based cattle operations and the resilience of these systems to climate extremes.

  ### Small Operations Face Uncertainty
    <p>
    Small AFOs, as defined by the USDA Census, are most commonly found in counties with abundant pasture land. These operations typically use pasture-based systems and have limited resources for intensive cooling or heat abatement. As a result, small AFOs are especially vulnerable to direct heat stress and to the compounding effects of drought and pasture degradation.

  ### Grasslands: Ecological Backbone of Cattle Production
    <p>
    Grasslands are not only the primary forage source for cattle but also play a crucial role in ecosystem health. Harvesting high quality forage from perennial grasslands is one of the cheapest ways to feed cows, and can be an effective way of reducing feed costs, one of the largest expenses on a farm.

    datetime='2017-01-01'
  >
  ### Large Operations: Resources But Still Vulnerable
  <p>
    Large AFOs are more likely to be located in regions with extensive grassland. These operations often confine or semi-confine their herds and generally have greater resources to invest in heat abatement technologies and advanced management. However, even large AFOs face significant obstacles during prolonged heat waves, as grassland systems are susceptible to drought and wildfires, which can impact both feed supply and animal welfare.

### Mapping the Current and Future Hotspots
   One primary metric for mapping county-level heat stress hotspots is the seasonal average number of days above a THI threshold (such as 75 or 82). For each county, we count the number of days in a season where the daily average THI exceeds the chosen threshold. This metric is especially valuable for tracking trends over time and for comparing the intensity of heat exposure between counties. By analyzing these seasonal averages, we can pinpoint areas where cattle are most vulnerable due to recurring high-THI conditions. For instance, there is signficant THI variability within counties in states like Montana, Colarado and Texas.

### Hotspot Persistence: Seasonal Fraction of Days Above THI Threshold
  To further refine hotspot identification, we use the seasonal fraction of days above a THI threshold. This metric calculates the proportion of days in a season where the THI exceeds the set threshold. High fractions indicate areas where heat stress is not only frequent but also persistent throughout the season. Such persistent exposure can have compounding effects on cattle health and productivity, making these counties priority targets for adaptation and mitigation efforts.

### The Accelerating Stress in Traditional Hot States
   States like Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma have long dealt with cattle heat stress, but recent years show the problem intensifying dramatically. Texas, the nation's largest cattle producer, faces particular challenges as heat stress conditions become more frequent and severe. Our preliminary correlation analysis shows strong relationships between cattle mortality and multiple climate variables.

    <h3>The Path Forward: Adaptation and Resilience</h3>
      If livestock are to adapt to new thermal environments and maintain productivity, infrastructural investments and management adjustments are essential. These include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Increase water access points</strong> and keep water sources shaded</li>
      <li><strong>Offer natural or artificial shade</strong> such as trees, shade cloths, or portable structures</li>
      <li><strong>Improve ventilation and air movement</strong> using fans, open barns, or windbreaks</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce stocking density</strong> to minimize crowding and heat buildup</li>
      <li><strong>Adjust feeding times</strong> to cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening)</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate pastures and maintain vegetative cover</strong> for cooler surfaces</li>
      <li><strong>Develop and implement a heat stress management plan</strong>, including early warning systems</li>
