     In June 2022, a devastating heat wave swept across Kansas, killing an estimated 10,000 cattle in a matter of days. The mass die-off raised urgent questions about the future of America’s $80 billion cattle industry—even in states once considered safe from extreme heat.
 <br /><br />
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment confirmed at least 2,000 [cattle deaths](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105482394/cattle-kansas-heat-wave) in the southwestern part of the state, though industry estimates suggest the total could be as high as 10,000 head lost during this single event. But Kansas was just the beginning. From the traditional heat of Texas to the surprising vulnerability of Montana, cattle across America are facing an escalating crisis that threatens both animal welfare and food security.

    ### The Hidden Scale of a Growing Crisis
     When we think about heat wave impacts, human health dominates the headlines. But livestock particularly cattle face their own deadly consequences from extreme temperatures, with profound economic implications rippling through the dairy and beef industries. What makes this crisis particularly alarming is that it's no longer confined to traditionally hot regions. States like Montana, Idaho, and Colorado are discovering their cattle are equally vulnerable to sudden temperature spikes. <br /><br />
The economic stakes couldn't be higher. Heat stress doesn't just kill cattle, it reduces feed intake, slows weight gain, decreases milk production, and impairs fertility across surviving herds. Each heat wave compounds these losses, creating a cascade of economic damage that ultimately reaches consumers through higher food prices.

### Understanding Why Cattle Are Vulnerable to Heat
     Understanding cattle vulnerability begins with a simple concept: just as the heat index measures human comfort, the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) measures cattle stress. But while humans can seek air conditioning, or modify their behavior, cattle have limited options.<br />
Cattle operate within a narrow comfort zone called the thermoneutral zone. Our analysis uses critical THI thresholds of 75, 82, and 94 representing escalating levels of heat stress risk (Lee et al., 2025). Think of these as warning levels:

- THI 75: Cattle begin showing mild stress signs
- THI 82: Significant physiological stress begins
- THI 94: Life-threatening conditions emerge

When temperatures and humidity push the THI above these values, cattle begin to suffer physiologically. Outside their thermoneutral zone, they experience reduced feed intake, slower weight gain, lower milk yield, and impaired fertility. When the heat load surpasses what their bodies can handle, the result is heat stress—or in severe cases, death.
The 2022 Kansas disaster illustrates this perfectly. The accompanying animation shows THI values during May and June 2022, revealing the extreme conditions that overwhelmed cattle across the state. What made this event particularly deadly was not just the peak temperatures, but the persistence of dangerous conditions day after day.

### The Surprise Threat: "Cold" States Aren't Safe
Perhaps most surprising is our finding that states traditionally considered cooler Montana, Idaho, and Colorado face significant cattle heat stress risks. These regions present a perfect storm of vulnerability:
- Lack of Acclimation: Cattle in these states are less adapted to heat and may still carry winter coats into summer, making sudden high temperatures even more dangerous.
- Rapid Dehydration: The dry air common in these semi-arid and mountainous regions accelerates dehydration during heat events, especially at higher elevations.
- Unpredictable Timing: Sharp temperature spikes catch both animals and producers off guard, with insufficient time to implement emergency cooling measures.
In these settings, our research shows that higher average relative humidity actually helps reduce dehydration.

  ### Climate Drivers: The Slow Aggravators
       While temperature is the primary driver of heat stress in cattle, other climate variables such as vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, and soil moisture also play critical roles. It is not just the average levels of these factors, but their variability that has a greater impact on cattle mortality.
### The Role of Drought and Soil Moisture
Soil moisture emerges as a critical but often overlooked factor. When soil moisture is depleted, the land loses its capacity to buffer temperature extremes, creating a feedback loop that makes cattle more vulnerable to combined heat and water scarcity. During the 2022 Kansas heat wave, SMAP soil moisture data showed severely depleted conditions across the region, amplifying the heat stress effects on cattle. This combination of drought and heat creates the perfect conditions for mass mortality events.

###   Precipitation Patterns Matter More Than Totals
In dry states like Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, it's not average precipitation but its variability that most strongly correlates with cattle mortality. High variability whether within a season or between years—disrupts:
- Forage Growth: Unpredictable rainfall creates feast-or-famine conditions for pasture
- Water Availability: Inconsistent precipitation affects water source reliability
- Pasture Quality: Variable moisture creates uneven forage nutrition and availability
This variability makes it nearly impossible for cattle to maintain condition and for producers to plan resources effectively.

  ### The Landscape of Vulnerability
  <p>
  Understanding where cattle are most vulnerable requires examining how operations align with natural resources and climate patterns. From open rangelands to intensively managed feedlots, the distribution of grassland and pasture shapes where and how cattle are raised.

  ### Pasture: The Forage Base for Cattle
  <p>
    Pasture and grassland provide the primary forage base for cattle in many counties, as shown by the percentage of pasture in each county from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The availability and quality of pasture directly influence the viability of pasture-based cattle operations and the resilience of these systems to climate extremes.

  ### Small Operations Face Greatest Risk
  <p>
    Small AFOs, as defined by the USDA Census, are most commonly found in counties with abundant pasture land. These operations typically use pasture-based systems and have limited resources for intensive cooling or heat abatement. As a result, small AFOs are especially vulnerable to direct heat stress and to the compounding effects of drought and pasture degradation.

  ### Grasslands: Ecological Backbone of Cattle Production
  <p>
    Grasslands are not only the primary forage source for cattle but also play a crucial role in ecosystem health. Harvesting high quality forage from perennial grasslands is one of the cheapest ways to feed cows, and can be an effective way of reducing feed costs, one of the largest expenses on a farm.

    datetime='2017-01-01'
  >
  ### Large Operations: Resources But Still Vulnerable
  <p>
    Large AFOs are more likely to be located in regions with extensive grassland. These operations often confine or semi-confine their herds and generally have greater resources to invest in heat abatement technologies and advanced management. However, even large AFOs face significant risks during prolonged heat waves, as grassland systems are susceptible to drought and wildfires, which can threaten both feed supply and animal welfare.

      ### The Critical Role of Vegetation Health
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides crucial insights into forage quality and vegetation stress. NDVI measures the "greenness" and health of plant cover, low values signal poor or stressed vegetation, directly impacting feed quality and availability for cattle.
Monitoring NDVI alongside climate variables provides a complete picture of environmental stressors affecting cattle health. During heat events, declining NDVI indicates not just immediate stress but also reduced nutritional quality of available forage, compounding the challenges cattle face.

### Mapping the Crisis: Current and Future Hotspots
   One primary metric for mapping county-level heat stress hotspots is the seasonal average number of days above a THI threshold (such as 75 or 82). For each county, we count the number of days in a season where the daily average THI exceeds the chosen threshold. This metric is especially valuable for tracking trends over time and for comparing the intensity of heat exposure between counties. By analyzing these seasonal averages, we can pinpoint areas where cattle are most at risk due to recurring high-THI conditions. For instance, there is signficant THI variability within counties in states like Montana, Colarado and Texas.

### Hotspot Persistence: Seasonal Fraction of Days Above THI Threshold
<p>
  To further refine hotspot identification, we use the seasonal fraction of days above a THI threshold. This metric calculates the proportion of days in a season where the THI exceeds the set threshold. High fractions indicate areas where heat stress is not only frequent but also persistent throughout the season. Such persistent exposure can have compounding effects on cattle health and productivity, making these counties priority targets for adaptation and mitigation efforts.

### The Accelerating Crisis in Traditional Hot States
   States like Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma have long dealt with cattle heat stress, but recent years show the problem intensifying dramatically. 
Texas, the nation's largest cattle producer, faces particular challenges as heat stress conditions become more frequent and severe. Our correlation analysis shows strong relationships between cattle mortality and multiple climate variables, with temperature variability emerging as a key factor even in traditionally hot regions.
Oklahoma and Nebraska show similar patterns, with increased variability in both temperature and humidity creating more dangerous conditions than cattle producers have historically managed.

  ### Future Projections: More Days Above 90°F
  Looking ahead, climate models project a dramatic increase in the number of extremely hot days—those above 90°F—across much of the U.S. Maps of projected future days above 90°F illustrate the scale of the challenge. These projections translate to:
- Increased Mortality: More frequent mass die-off events
- Reduced Productivity: Chronic stress affecting milk production and weight gain
- Economic Losses: Billions in additional costs for cooling infrastructure and feed
- Food Security Risks: Potential disruptions to beef and dairy supplies underscoring the urgent need for adaptive management and heat abatement strategies to protect animal welfare and sustain cattle production in a warming climate.

     ### The Path Forward: Adaptation and Resilience
     If livestock are to adapt to new thermal environments and maintain productivity, infrastructural investments and management adjustments are essential. These include:
     - Increase water access points and keep water sources shaded
     - Offer natural or artificial shade (trees, shade cloths, portable structures)
     - Improve ventilation and air movement (fans, open barns, windbreaks)
     - Reduce stocking density to minimize crowding and heat buildup
     - Adjust feeding times to cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening)
     - Rotate pastures and maintain vegetative cover for cooler surfaces
     - Develop and implement a heat stress management plan, including early warning systems
