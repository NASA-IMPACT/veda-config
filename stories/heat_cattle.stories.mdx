    ### The Overlooked Cost of Heat Stress on Cattle: Beyond the Thermometer
     When considering the impacts of heat waves, we often focus on human health. However, livestock, particularly cattle, can also be severely affected by extreme heat. Heat stress in cattle is an important and growing concern in both traditionally hot and cooler regions of the United States, with profound economic consequences for the dairy and beef industries.

    <p>
   ### Why Cattle Are So Vulnerable to Heat
     Cattle are particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures. Their comfort zone, known as the thermoneutral zone, is relatively narrow. For our analysis, we considered critical thresholds for the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) at 75, 82, and 94 (Lee et al., 2025) which correspond to increasing levels of heat stress risk. When temperatures and humidity push the THI above these values, cattle begin to suffer physiologically. Outside of their thermoneutral zone (roughly 41°F to 77°F, or THI above 75), cattle experience reduced feed intake, slower liveweight gain, lower milk yield, and impaired fertility. Unlike humans, cattle have a limited ability to sweat. To cool down, they rely on increased breathing, radiating heat, and reducing their feed intake. But as they eat less to stay cool, their energy and milk or weight gain also declines. When the heat load surpasses what their bodies can handle, the result is heat stress, or in severe cases, death.

   ### Variability Matters: More Than Just the Mean
     Our findings indicate that it is the variability in THI—especially seasonal swings—rather than just the mean THI that most strongly impacts cattle mortality. Notably, increased variability in THI has been observed to raise mortality during cooler months and, paradoxically, decrease mortality in summer months in hotter states like Texas and Nebraska (see Fig). This suggests that cattle may be less able to adapt to unexpected swings in thermal stress outside the traditional summer peak, making year-round management and monitoring increasingly important.

   ### Prolonged Dry Conditions
   Los Angeles County, characterized by its Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, has experienced an extended period of dry conditions over the past year. As illustrated in the figure, which presents rainfall data from in-situ observations at ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System) stations across the region. One year ago, Los Angeles faced severe flooding and landslides due to a series of intense storms in early 2023, which effectively ended a long-term drought that had persisted for several years. The sudden influx of moisture led to widespread vegetation growth, as plants rapidly absorbed the available water. However, with limited rainfall over the past year, much of this vegetation has dried out, transforming into highly flammable fuel. This prolonged period of arid conditions, combined with the abundance of dried vegetation, has greatly increased the region’s wildfire risk.

  ### Climate Drivers: The Slow Aggravators
    <p> 
       While temperature and humidity are the primary drivers of heat stress, other climate variables such as solar radiation (SRAD), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation also play critical roles. It is not just the mean levels of these factors, but their variability that exerts a larger impact on cattle mortality. For example: 
       - Drought conditions reduce pasture quality and water availability, leaving cattle more vulnerable to heat stress.
       - Sudden heavy rains can spike humidity, pushing the THI above critical thresholds and compounding heat risk.
       - Persistent drought has already contributed to shrinking cattle herds and higher feed costs, further straining producers.

  ### Fire Suppression and the Accumulation of Fuel
     <p>
    Although chaparral shrublands are adapted to fire cycles, decades of aggressive fire suppression, coupled with worsening drought, have heightened wildfire vulnerability. Similarly, grasslands, which are dominated by fine fuels, are highly susceptible to rapid ignition and fast-moving fires. The figure below presents NLCD analysis for Palisades, indicating that ~70% of the region consists of shrublands.

  ### Factors Influencing Containment
    The Eaton Fire impacted a mix of shrublands (~55%), evergreen forests (~20%), and developed land (~11%). The higher moisture content of evergreen forests compared to shrublands likely slowed the fire's progression and aided containment efforts. Additionally, the slightly lower proportion of shrublands compared to the Palisades Fire may have contributed to a reduction in the fire's overall intensity.

   ### Air Quality in Los Angeles: TEMPO and EPA AirNow Insights Post-Wildfires
    The wildfires have significantly deteriorated air quality, with high concentrations of pollutants affecting both urban and suburban areas. To assess the impact, we utilized data from NASA's Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument and the EPA’s AirNow system. These datasets provide a comprehensive view of air pollution levels, both spatially and locally, helping to identify the severity and spread of harmful pollutants.

     ### The Path Forward: Adaptation and Resilience
     If livestock are to adapt to new thermal environments and maintain productivity, infrastructural investments and management adjustments are essential. These include:
     - Increase water access points and keep water sources shaded
     - Offer natural or artificial shade (trees, shade cloths, portable structures)
     - Improve ventilation and air movement (fans, open barns, windbreaks)
     - Reduce stocking density to minimize crowding and heat buildup
     - Adjust feeding times to cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening)
     - Rotate pastures and maintain vegetative cover for cooler surfaces
     - Develop and implement a heat stress management plan, including early warning systems
