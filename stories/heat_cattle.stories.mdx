    ### Heat Stress on Cattle
     When considering the impacts of heat waves, we often focus on human health. However, livestock, particularly cattle, can also be severely affected by extreme heat. Heat stress in cattle is an important and growing concern in both traditionally hot and cooler regions of the United States, with profound economic consequences for the dairy and beef industries.

      ### Why Cattle Are So Vulnerable to Heat
     Cattle are particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures. Their comfort zone, known as the thermoneutral zone, is relatively narrow. For our analysis, we considered critical thresholds for the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) at 75, 82, and 94 (Lee et al., 2025) which correspond to increasing levels of heat stress risk. When temperatures and humidity push the THI above these values, cattle begin to suffer physiologically. Outside of their thermoneutral zone (roughly 41°F to 77°F, or THI above 75), cattle experience reduced feed intake, slower liveweight gain, lower milk yield, and impaired fertility. Unlike humans, cattle have a limited ability to sweat. To cool down, they rely on increased breathing, radiating heat, and reducing their feed intake. But as they eat less to stay cool, their energy and milk or weight gain also declines. When the heat load surpasses what their bodies can handle, the result is heat stress, or in severe cases, death.

      ### Heat Stress Risks in Small vs. Large Cattle Operations
     To better understand how cattle operations are affected by heat stress, we combined USDA Census data on animal feeding operation (AFO) sizes with pasture and grassland percentages from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). 
     - Small AFOs (as defined by the USDA Census) are most commonly located in counties or areas with the highest percentage of pasture land. These smaller operations typically rely on pasture-based systems and often lack the resources for intensive cooling or heat abatement infrastructure. As a result, their herds are especially vulnerable to both direct heat stress and the added challenges of drought and pasture degradation.
     - Large AFOs, on the other hand, are most closely associated with areas that have the highest percentage of grassland. These larger operations tend to keep more of their herd in confined or semi-confined settings and generally have greater access to capital for investing in heat abatement technologies and advanced management practices. Nevertheless, large operations still face significant risks during prolonged or extreme heat events, since grassland systems are also susceptible to drought and wildfires.
     By integrating these two data sources, we were able to assess how operation size and land cover type influence cattle vulnerability to heat stress, offering a nuanced view of land use and risk trends across U.S. agriculture.

  ### Mapping County Pasture and Grassland
  <p>
    The foundation of cattle operations is the landscape itself. The following maps show the percentage of pasture and grassland in each county, based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Areas with higher percentages of pasture and grassland provide more natural forage for cattle, but are also more exposed to climate extremes. Understanding these patterns is the first step in assessing heat stress risk for cattle.

  ### Small Cattle Operations and Pasture Reliance
  <p>
    Small Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs), as defined by the USDA Census, are most commonly found in counties with abundant pasture land. These operations typically use pasture-based systems and have limited resources for intensive cooling or heat abatement. As a result, small AFOs are especially vulnerable to direct heat stress and to the compounding effects of drought and pasture degradation.

  ### Large Cattle Operations and Grassland Systems
  <p>
    Large AFOs are more likely to be located in regions with extensive grassland. These operations often confine or semi-confine their herds and generally have greater resources to invest in heat abatement technologies and advanced management. However, even large AFOs face significant risks during prolonged heat waves, as grassland systems are susceptible to drought and wildfires, which can threaten both feed supply and animal welfare.

   ### Variability Matters: More Than Just the Mean
     Our findings indicate that it is the variability in THI—especially seasonal swings—rather than just the mean THI that most strongly impacts cattle mortality. Notably, increased variability in THI has been observed to raise mortality during cooler months and, paradoxically, decrease mortality in summer months in hotter states like Texas and Nebraska (see Fig). This suggests that cattle may be less able to adapt to unexpected swings in thermal stress outside the traditional summer peak, making year-round management and monitoring increasingly important.

      ### Climate Drivers: The Slow Aggravators
       While temperature is the primary driver of heat stress in cattle, other climate variables such as vapor pressure deficit, relative humidity, and precipitation also play critical roles. It is not just the average levels of these factors, but their variability that has a greater impact on cattle mortality. For example, increased variability in relative humidity exposes cattle to frequent and unpredictable shifts between dry and humid conditions, challenging their ability to acclimate, disrupting thermoregulation, and increasing physiological stress. Rapid changes in humidity can also interact with temperature extremes, as reflected in the THI, amplifying heat load during hot, humid spikes and raising mortality risk. Similarly, in dry states like Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, it is precipitation variability rather than average precipitation that is strongly correlated with cattle mortality. High variability in precipitation, whether within a season or between years, disrupts forage growth, water availability, and pasture quality, making it difficult for cattle to maintain condition and for producers to plan resources. Sudden droughts can cause acute shortages of feed and water, leading to spikes in mortality, while heavy rains can increase humidity and push THI above critical thresholds, compounding heat stress.

  ### Hot States: A Familiar but Escalating Problem
    <p> 
      In places like Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma, heat stress is a recurring challenge but it’s getting worse. Kansas, the third-largest cattle-producing state, was hit especially hard in 2022, exacerbating an industry already struggling with the smallest U.S. herd in decades due to persistent drought and high feed costs.

  ### Cold States: Not as Safe as They Seem
     <p>
      States like Montana, Idaho, and Colorado, often associated with cooler temperatures, are not immune. Cattle here may be less acclimated to heat and can still carry winter coats into summer, making sudden high temperatures even more dangerous. Sharp temperature spikes in these regions can catch both animals and producers off guard. Colorado and Idaho are generally considered cooler, more temperate, and often semi-arid or mountainous states. Their cattle are more likely to experience dry air and rapid dehydration during heat events, especially at higher elevations or during summer droughts. In these settings, a higher average relative humidity can indeed help reduce dehydration and moderate temperature swings, which is beneficial for cattle health. (Analysis png maps).

     ### The Path Forward: Adaptation and Resilience
     If livestock are to adapt to new thermal environments and maintain productivity, infrastructural investments and management adjustments are essential. These include:
     - Increase water access points and keep water sources shaded
     - Offer natural or artificial shade (trees, shade cloths, portable structures)
     - Improve ventilation and air movement (fans, open barns, windbreaks)
     - Reduce stocking density to minimize crowding and heat buildup
     - Adjust feeding times to cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening)
     - Rotate pastures and maintain vegetative cover for cooler surfaces
     - Develop and implement a heat stress management plan, including early warning systems
