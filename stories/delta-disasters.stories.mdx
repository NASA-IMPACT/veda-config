    ## Introduction

    In 2019, a slow-moving, silent disaster unfolded across the Mississippi Delta. More than half a million acres of land remained underwater for months from what became known as the Yazoo Backwater Flood — a prolonged and largely overlooked catastrophe that devastated communities, ecosystems, and economies across the region. The water lingered for up to 219 days in some places, destroying homes, drowning farmland, and leaving behind residual soil stress and degradation that would ripple well into the future.

  While the floodwaters eventually receded, its repercussions endured. Years after being inundated for months, on March 24, 2023, the town of Rolling Fork, Mississippi was struck by a powerful high-end EF-4 (Enhanced Fujita Scale) tornado, flattening entire neighborhoods and causing catastrophic damage. Though seemingly disconnected by time and type of disaster, the impacts of the two events are certainly connected. The lasting environmental, infrastructural, and psychological impacts of the 2019 flood played a critical role in amplifying the destruction and trauma caused by the tornado.

  Ultimately, these compounding disasters substantially affected the livelihood of already vulnerable and less resilient communities. Environmental stressors, repeated long-term flooding, and delays in mitigation efforts are contributing to an elevated disaster risk in this region. NASA Earth-observing satellite data provide valuable insight into how past events continue to shape the area’s ability to withstand future hazards.

    ## Agricultural Loss in the Delta

    In spring 2019, as the Mississippi River and its tributaries swelled, hundreds of thousands of acres in the Delta remained submerged for months, and cropland bore the brunt of the impact. Using the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Cropland Data Layer and Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS)-derived Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), we can visualize the extent and persistence of surface water over key agricultural zones. USDA data show flooded areas were dominated by soybeans, corn, and cotton — high-value crops typically planted in April or May. However, planting had to be delayed or canceled altogether across vast stretches, forcing farmers to file lengthy insurance claims to compensate for their desolate yields. Farmers who missed federal insurance deadlines faced severe economic losses that lingered into subsequent growing seasons.

    ## Soil Moisture and Groundwater Disruption

    The 2019 flood not only destroyed crops but also left behind prolonged soil saturation and disrupted groundwater storage patterns. Using NASA’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) observed surface soil moisture anomaly data, conditions in May 2019 show above average anomalies across much of the Mississippi River watershed, reflecting excess water trapped in the soil long after precipitation had ended.

    In addition, NASA LIS (Land Information System) data reveal elevated evapotranspiration (ET) and subsurface runoff in the spring of 2019 when floodwaters from the Midwest and Great Plains funneled downstream. These runoff surges overwhelmed an already oversaturated Delta, expanding the flood’s reach. The combined effects of these anomalies suggest long-term impacts on aquifers, particularly for farmers relying on well systems for irrigation. In some of the hardest-hit areas, recovery of groundwater equilibrium has been delayed for years.

    ## Water Quality and Infrastructure Strain

    Prolonged floodwaters can leach contaminants from fields, industrial sites, and septic systems into waterways and aquifers. Although detailed water quality metrics are not publicly available, proxy indicators from LIS subsurface runoff and stream gauge records point to extensive overland flow and potential contamination pathways. Infrastructure shortcomings — particularly the long-delayed Yazoo Backwater Pump Project — meant that no mechanical systems were in place to remove floodwaters. The pump project, originally authorized in 1941, remained stalled in 2019 despite repeated disasters and growing evidence of its necessity.

    ## Health and Housing Impacts

    With homes submerged for months, hazardous mold outbreaks became widespread. Residents of the Delta region reported persistent respiratory problems, and health care sites in the area struggled to meet these growing needs. Numerous homes already vulnerable due to poor construction and old age now faced structural degradation from prolonged inundation leading to the rapid growth of mold in their foundations and walls.

    As a result of these compounding, far-reaching, and long-lasting impacts of the Yazoo Backwater Flood, some residents moved away and never returned. Others went through rebuilding processes, but the physical and emotional weight of the disaster was substantial. Unfortunately, for many who did decide to stay, they had to start over again just four years after the flood.

    ## Rolling Fork: Disaster Returns

    On March 24, 2023, a violent high-end EF-4 tornado tore through the town of Rolling Fork after dusk, leading to devastating impacts in an already strained area trying to recover from the 2019 flood. Commercial satellite imagery from Planet Labs reveals entire neighborhoods flattened adjacent to or in the same areas that were inundated for months in 2019. National Weather Service (NWS) post-storm surveys confirmed that this tornado traveled for nearly 60 miles through an area heavily impacted by the 2019 flooding of the Delta. With maximum windspeeds reaching 195 mph, this tornado was the strongest in the United States since 2020. The NWS found that 78% of Rolling Fork sustained some degree of damage, with the town of Silver Fork seeing 96% of its structures sustaining damage.

Recurring disasters only made matters worse by increasing the strain on infrastructure within the impacted areas, resulting in progressively slower recovery timelines after each event.

    ## A Compounding Crisis of Risk and Recovery

    In the aftermath of the 2019 Backwater Flood, many residents faced steep hurdles navigating insurance claims — if they had coverage at all. With much of the flooding in the Mississippi Delta classified as backwater or not originating from the mainline river system, thousands of households discovered their damages fell outside the bounds of traditional flood insurance policies. Others, having missed key enrollment deadlines or lacking access to federal flood programs were left entirely uninsured. These gaps in coverage translated into long, difficult recoveries — both financially and emotionally. When the EF‑4 tornado struck Rolling Fork in 2023, it exposed and deepened these vulnerabilities. Some residents were still managing unresolved claims from the flood; others had become uninsured altogether, having lost confidence in the process or had been priced out. Together, these compounding disasters reveal a critical need for more resilient, properly prepared insurance frameworks that account for the cumulative toll of repeated events — not just isolated hazards.

    NASA Earth observation data reveal a region caught in a cycle of exposure, impact, and incomplete recovery. By integrating satellite observations with ground-based assessments, we gain a clearer picture of how past disasters shape future risk. Understanding these patterns is essential for improving preparedness, guiding investment in mitigation, and supporting the long-term resilience of communities that find themselves in similar situations that the Mississippi Delta did in 2019 and 2023.
