    Baltimore is a dynamic urban area with a rich cultural history that reflects its location on the Patapsco River, home to one of the busiest ports on the East Coast. However, like many historically industrial cities, the city is facing environmental challenges which are made worse by aging, carbon-inefficient infrastructure and climate change.

    To mitigate and protect against impacts on city residents, Baltimore leaders have committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency in an [ambitious climate action plan](https://www.baltimoresustainability.org/plans/climate-action-plan/).

    Scientists from universities and U.S. government agencies have come together for cooperative research projects, helping to expand environmental monitoring capabilities across the city and metropolitan region. The innovative datasets developed offer detailed information on water and air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, urban vegetation and urban heat stress, providing trustworthy information to city decisionmakers as they consider climate-friendly modernization efforts.

      ## Baltimore Testbed Data Available Now
      The Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan region has been an important testbed for a NIST climate research project since 2015, following two others established earlier in Indianapolis and Los Angeles. The <Link to="/stories/urban-testbed">Urban Greenhouse Gas Measurements Testbeds System,</Link>now available on the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) portal, aims to produce high-quality greenhouse gas measurements in urban areas to help cities and industries better understand and manage their emissions.

      In testbed cities, government and academic researchers use networks of tower-based sensors to measure the concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. They then produce detailed emissions maps, which help city managers track emissions.
      
      NIST data provide a long and reliable record that shows how emissions from collective sources within the cities have changed over time, helping researchers and decision-makers track progress towards emissions reduction goals.

      There are plans for the project to expand the Baltimore and D.C. testbed, which was established in 2015, to the wider Northeast Corridor region with the addition of sites in Philadelphia and New York.

    ## Academia and Government Join Forces to Examine Community Impact
    In addition to long-standing, foundational measurements, new research initiatives by universities and U.S. government agencies are helping to provide further locally-relevant data and insights to state, county, and city officials in the region.

    Funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), Johns Hopkins University is leading the Baltimore Social and Environmental Collaborative, a group of researchers and community organizations focused on delivering studies to inform the city’s climate action plans and efforts to improve resident well-being in underserved neighborhoods.

    Looking at atmospheric measurements from towers including NIST testbed sites, combined with data collected from 45 air quality monitors and more than 30 weather stations deployed across Baltimore, the collaborative’s researchers are examining air and water quality, greenhouse gases, heat stress, and climate.

    These measurements can then be used by researchers to assess the impacts of local policy. Equipped with these findings, decision-makers will be able to consider fair distribution of sustainability efforts among all city neighborhoods, particularly in underserved areas with worse air and water quality.

    Also part of the collaborative, Pennsylvania State University is leading a multi-institution study called the Coast-Urban-Rural Atmospheric Gradient Experiment, in which they will deploy advanced mobile atmospheric measurement facilities, using [DOE instruments and infrastructure](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/observatories/amf), around Baltimore for a year starting in late 2024.

    At four sites – in downtown Baltimore, a nearby rural area, on a Chesapeake Bay island, and in the D.C. area – portable observatories will collect data to improve predictive models and better understand the unique atmospheric conditions of coastal cities and how the air quality, climate and precipitation in cities are influenced by nearby marine, rural and urban areas.

    By integrating greenhouse gas data with air quality, heat, precipitation, and health impacts data, these studies can support state and local efforts to improve the health of people living in underserved neighborhoods, as well as guiding climate mitigation efforts for global benefit.

    ## New Observations to Come from the US GHG Center
    The US GHG Center has joined the efforts in Baltimore and will soon be coordinating new aircraft-based measurement projects with [NOAA](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/airmaps/) and [NASA](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/) to complement and improve ground-based measurements. 

    These airborne observations allow for direct measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations in Earth’s lower atmosphere and make this data readily available for researchers to validate and improve their own measurement and monitoring capabilities.  In particular, these data enable comparison to and validation of satellite-based measurements of greenhouse gases and other urban air pollutants.

    Through these intensive, localized studies, researchers aim to develop new techniques that inform stakeholders how to combine satellite information and ground-based sensors for a more complete view of urban greenhouse gas emissions, in Baltimore and beyond.
