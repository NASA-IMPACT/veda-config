    ## What is methane and why is it important?
    Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, behind carbon dioxide CO2 and is a ‘potent’ greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. It is responsible for about one third of all warming resulting from human emissions. Also, methane has a shorter lifetime than carbon dioxide, meaning it leaves the atmosphere much faster. These factors make reducing methane emissions one of the best opportunities for reducing near term global warming.

    Over the last two centuries, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled. While some methane emissions come from natural sources, many sources are from human-related activities including agriculture, oil and natural gas systems, landfills, coal mining, stationary and mobile combustion, wastewater treatment, and certain industrial processes.

            ### GHG Inventories are a fundamental tool for promoting international cooperation to address climate change

            The 1992 United Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international treaty that established a framework for international cooperation to achieve “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” (Article 2). Towards this end, signatories to this U.N. framework (UNFCCC) are committed to developing and reporting “national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases” (Article 4). These inventories provide a scientific basis for tracking and planning emission mitigation efforts to achieve the long-term objective of the Convention. Inventory reporting is also a continued commitment under Article 13 of the 2015 U.N. Paris Agreement.

            ### Creating GHG Inventories with a Consistent Methodology

            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assesses the scientific, technical, and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style={{ color: '#0000EE' }}>(IPCC, 2021)↗</a>. To consistently create internationally acceptable inventories of greenhouse gases, the IPCC issues methodology reports. These methods are largely based on an approach that combines information on human activity data and factors that quantify the amount of emissions or removal per unit of activity. For example it has data on how much fuel is used by human activity as well as the amount of methane emissions released from using that fuel.

            These methods can be more or less complex depending on the type of data available for a given source or gas. Currently, national inventories reported to the UNFCCC are required to use methods consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories <a href="https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style={{ color: '#0000EE' }}>(2006, IPCC)↗</a>, and its subsequent supplements and refinements, where appropriate.

            ### Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks

             As a Party to the UNFCCC, the U.S. submits a national inventory of anthropogenic sources and sinks of GHGs by April 15th each year, called the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style={{"color": "#0000EE"}}>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (GHGI)↗</a>. The EPA has prepared this report since the early 1990s. It uses IPCC Guidelines to calculate the annual time series of anthropogenic emissions and sinks by source, economic sector, and GHG (including methane). Separately through the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style={{ color: '#0000EE' }}>Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)↗</a>, the EPA also collects annual GHG emissions data (including methane) from individual facilities and suppliers of certain fossil fuels and industrial gases that emit more than 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year. The GHGRP does not provide full coverage of total annual anthropogenic U.S. GHG emissions, but both data sets are complementary to each other and the GHGRP data is included in the inventory data.

            ### Using atmospheric observations to identify areas for improvement in national methane estimates

            Over the last two decades there have been advancements in measuring human-caused methane emissions using instruments on satellites, aircraft, and mobile platforms. Also, scientists use inverse modeling. This is a mathematical technique to infer emissions from concentrations and it has revolutionized the ability to estimate methane emissions such as from biological activity, leaks, and other fugitive sources. However, a more localized spatial representation of inventory emissions is needed to determine the types of direct comparisons that can enable these local and regional estimates to inform inventory improvements (2019 IPCC Refinements).

            ## A Spatial U.S. Methane Emissions Dataset for Research

            Showing U.S. methane emissions across a map, spatially, enables more direct comparisons between atmospheric observations and U.S. inventory estimates. This dataset currently includes maps of U.S. methane emissions from human activity from over 25 individual sources, at the 10 x 10 km scale, for the years 2012 through 2020. Compared to other ‘gridded’ emission products, this dataset is uniquely consistent with the U.S. GHGI, meaning that when summed, gridded methane estimates will equal total contiguous U.S. methane emissions in the U.S. GHGI. As discussed in a recent <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5623/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style={{ color: '#0000EE' }}>paper↗</a>, this consistency is maintained by allocating U.S. GHGI methane emissions to each grid cell using, where available, the same activity data (e.g., animal counts, gas well locations and production volumes, etc.) that was used to calculate the national inventory estimates. This dataset was developed through a collaboration between researchers at the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research, Harvard University, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL), and the EPA.

        ## Emissions from Agriculture

        Agriculture emissions are the largest anthropogenic source of methane, primarily associated with the digestion of animals, manure management, and rice cultivation. Methane emission hotspots are mainly associated with concentrated animal populations (e.g., dairy cattle in California and Iowa and hogs in North Carolina) and areas of rice cultivation (e.g., northern California and along the southern Mississippi river).

        ## Emissions from Natural Gas and Petroleum

        Methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum activities are primarily associated with activities in oil and gas production basins. Methane is also emitted from activities related to the transmission, storage, and distribution of natural gas and crude oil, with emissions largely distributed along pipelines or concentrated at storage sites, transport terminals, refineries, or in densely populated areas.

        Remaining inventory methane emissions are from relatively smaller sources of methane, including transportation, industrial facilities, power plants, and abandoned oil and gas wells. Many of these emissions are associated with individual facilities, well locations, concentrated in populated regions, or are spread across road systems.

        For example, total U.S. agriculture methane emissions fell between 2012 and 2020. However, emissions in some regions increased, largely depending on how animal populations and manure management systems changed in these locations.

        National total methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems decreased between 2012 and 2020 due to reduced emission well completions, increased use of low-emitting production equipment, and transition to less-leaky distribution pipeline materials. However, methane emissions still increased in some regions, in part due to changes in production volumes, and processing, refining, and transport and storage emissions.

        ## Summary
        Detailed maps of methane emissions help us to better understand the different sources, spatial patterns, and trends in U.S. methane emissions. This particular gridded dataset is unique in that it allows for a more direct comparison of methane emission estimates in the U.S. inventory to those derived from atmospheric observations, thereby helping to improve the emissions information that allows us to track progress towards our collective climate goals.
