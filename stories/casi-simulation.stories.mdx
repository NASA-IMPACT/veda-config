  ## Introduction
  The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) 2009 Climate Impacts Report concluded that human-induced climate change is happening now, the impacts are already apparent, and greater impacts are projected, particularly if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. By developing climate adaptation strategies tailored to the specific risks and impacts anticipated, NASA decision-makers are able to minimize negative effects of climate extremes and climate change while leveraging positive outcomes. Because effective risk management requires the best possible understanding of hazards, NASA organized the Climate Adaptation Science Investigator Work Group (CASI) to expand collaboration among its Earth scientists, applications researchers, and institutional stewards. According to the CASI‚Äôs mission statement, they aim to advance and apply NASA‚Äôs scientific expertise and products to develop climate adaptation strategies that support NASA‚Äôs overall mission by minimizing risks to each center‚Äôs operations, physical and biological assets, and personnel. While CASI is principally a science effort, its foundation rests on partnering with representatives from many Center organizations, including infrastructure, environmental management, master planning, human resources, and emergency planning and response, all working together to disseminate and use climate science knowledge tailored to enable development of center-specific adaptation solutions. The CASI dataset provides the monthly statistics of root zone soil moisture percentiles at the global scale with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree (approximately 10km at the equator). The dataset temporal period spans a historical period of 1950-2014 and a projection period of 2015-2100. It contains the minimum, median, and maximum of the root zone soil moisture percentile values, which were calculated from a total of 25 ensemble members.

  ## Comparison of soil moisture percentile between two years  
  Building on stakeholder feedback and advancements in Earth observations and data assimilation, teams across NASA are working on major enhancements to the NLDAS environment called ‚ÄúNLDAS Phase 3‚Äù (NLDAS-3). The vision for NLDAS-3 is to provide near field scale (~1 km), high-quality, observation-informed estimates of land surface and hydrology conditions. Specifically, NLDAS-3 aims to:   
  - **Significant increase in soil moisture**:  
    Big jump in soil moisture percentile in the Arctic zone during the year of 2090-2099 compared to the historical period of 2000-2010.
  - **Drop in soil moisture percentile in Amazon**:  
    A hotspot in Amazon where soil moisture will drop significantly during the projected period of 2090-2099.
  - **Showing increasing pattern in China**:  
    Data from our model simulations indicate increasing soil moisture gradually over the Central China region.
  - **Northern Africa is showing mixed pattern**:  
    Northern Africa shows a significant drop and rise in soil moisture due to soil drying and more drought phenomena in the upcoming years.

  Using satellite data to study soil moisture dynamics, the soil moisture percentile was calculated from 25 different ensembles. An example of the spread of soil moisture percentile data is shown in the snapshot to understand the difference between the different percentiles. The figure shows the difference between the minimum and maximum of 25 ensembles over the 20-year period (2090-2099).
