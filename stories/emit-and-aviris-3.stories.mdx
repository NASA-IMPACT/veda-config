            Detailed observations of methane plumes are now possible by combining two very different data sets. One set is from the AVIRIS-3 airborne imaging spectrometer, the other from the space-based instrument EMIT. Taken together, scientists have an unprecedented ability to analyze emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, methane.

        ## Methane Super Emitter Detection from Space
        A host of phenomena across the globe generate methane greenhouse gas emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. Pinpointing and quantifying “super emitter” methane events is a critical step in understanding how methane sources impact our atmosphere and planet.

        But this is no small task. Ambitious levels of coordination and instrument sensitivity are required to gather the thorough, detailed observations necessary to compile reliable datasets for scientists and decision makers to use.

        Orbiting 150 miles above Earth’s surface on the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/), the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) [monitors methane and carbon dioxide emissions](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/stories/discovering-large-methane-emissions) by observing the shortwave infrared (SWIR), a region of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/) where carbon dioxide and methane gases absorb light. This absorption process alters the properties of light at specific wavelengths and thus can be detected by EMIT. The instrument gathers data through imaging spectroscopy, a remote sensing technique used to detect subtle changes in the sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere. Based on spectral properties of the infrared light that EMIT measures, scientists can identify areas of the atmosphere that have high concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide. Although [EMIT’s primary mission](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/) is to observe desert and arid regions that contribute to Earth’s mineral dust cycle, the instrument’s high sensitivity to methane point source emissions enables scientists to observe thousands of large methane emission events across the globe. In turn, scientists have developed and shared valuable new data products like the EMIT Methane Point Source Plume Complex example shown below.

        Despite EMIT’s unparalleled ability to detect methane plumes from space, there are limitations to these remote sensing observations. As an instrument aboard the International Space Station, EMIT is constrained to the station’s orbital patterns and positions. Also, the 60 m spatial resolution of EMIT does not permit it to observe smaller emission sources from space. Uniting airborne and spaceborne data addresses these issues and allows scientists to study methane super emitters from multiple perspectives.

        ## Instrument Twins: Spaceborne and Airborne
        In 2023, NASA began flying a new airborne instrument to measure methane and carbon dioxide point source emissions data in much the same way that EMIT does from space. AVIRIS-3 stands for the third generation of Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometers. It is an advanced imaging spectrometer system developed and operated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Designed to capture high-resolution spectral imagery of Earth's surface in visible and infrared wavelengths analogous to EMIT measurements (see table below), AVIRIS-3 is an ideal companion instrument to EMIT, offering enhanced greenhouse gas sensitivity from locations much closer to the ground. AVIRIS-3 can be flown on a variety of aircraft.

        AVIRIS-3 and EMIT are the latest generation of high-performance imaging spectrometers developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

        ## Observation Coordination
        It’s difficult enough to gather reliable data with one instrument, let alone two instruments positioned hundreds of miles apart and moving at vastly different velocities. While the International Space Station orbits Earth at around 28,000 km/hr (~17,398 miles/hr), aircraft move much slower at ~322 km/hr (200 miles/hr). However, both are required to simultaneously observe a single methane super emitter event. By doing so, greenhouse gas retrieval and emission quantification algorithms can be performed on concurrent AVIRIS-3 and EMIT observations and the results evaluated. This type of coordinated measurement is referred to by scientists as “cal/val”, which stands for calibration and validation. Cal/val is a critical process for space and airborne scientific instruments in which collected data are calibrated, validated, and verified to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and consistency.

        Obtaining coincident AVIRIS-3 and EMIT observations requires significant planning. This starts with tracking the EMIT forecasted location, assessing the weather forecast, and identifying a good location. In the case shown below, researchers chose the Permian Basin to observe methane emissions for a week.

        The NASA JPL AVIRIS-3 flight crew flew from Pasadena, CA to Midland, TX a few days before the planned coordinated effort. They used a real time methane display on the plane to select one methane emission source to target the next day (see image below). On the day of the scheduled EMIT overpass, the AVIRIS-3 flight crew performed repeat observations of the target location and timed one aircraft observation within a few seconds of the EMIT overpass time (see video below). This tightly coordinated measurement resulted in AVIRIS-3 and EMIT making separate observations within a few seconds. The result clearly shows the same methane plume observed from both aircraft and space (see GIF below).

        ## Enhanced Methane Emission Observations on the Horizon
        The US GHG Center continues to fund AVIRIS-3 airborne campaigns to gather the best airborne methane and carbon dioxide emission data to date. With improved greenhouse gas sensitivity due to enhanced spatial resolution, AVIRIS-3 complements EMIT’s space-based observations. Combining greenhouse gas super emitter observations from AVIRIS-3 and EMIT gives scientists the ability to analyze emissions at an exceptional level. By offering access to AVIRIS-3 data alongside EMIT datasets, the US GHG Center enables better utility and coordination of airborne and satellite data to study methane super emitter phenomena.
