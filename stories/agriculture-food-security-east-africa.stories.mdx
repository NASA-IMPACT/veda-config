    A productive agricultural eco-system is vital in maintaining the food supply for our growing population. Weather conditions and other uncontrollable factors can tilt the balance toward healthy, abundant crops or food insecurity, (unreliable access to nutritious food).

    A current example of weather-related food insecurity is happening in Africa. A region of particular concern is Eastern Africa, particularly Sudan, South Sudan, northeastern Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Yemen, in which the rainy seasons over the past four consecutive seasons have failed to provide the water needed to maintain necessary soil moisture levels. This has resulted in the worst drought in 70 years, leaving more than 16 million people to struggle with a lack of drinking water. Similarly, more than nine million livestock animals have died or been culled, (selectively slaughtered) because of the lack of water and usable land and grass. Without the water needed to nourish young seedlings, yields of key crops are down for the third year in a row. 
    
    NASA researchers are using satellites and data to monitor, track and predict changes in crop activity to help inform policy makers of the future consequences of this drought.
    
    Researchers are analyzing data that suggest climate change is the major factor in the instability of weather, which ultimately affects agriculture crop production. A low or bad crop can lead to food insecurity and a host of other harmful conditions.
    Advanced technology and satellite data can provide researchers with helpful findings about things such as soil moisture and rainfall, which can show current conditions as well as predict changes over the upcoming months. This helps farmers, agricultural agencies, governments, and humanitarian organizations prepare for forecasted droughts and crop failures that could lead to water and food insecurity. This kind of data can also help researchers track long-term trends in climate change, its effects on at-risk populations, and formulate potential solutions for future problems. 

    Insights into agricultural developmental and rainfall patterns are some of the most meaningful information provided by Earth observing satellites. The NASA Hydrological Forecast and Analysis System (NHyFAS) team generates and analyzes data on moisture levels on the soil surface and in the top few centimeters of soil. A custom product of NHyFAS, the FLDAS Forecast supports the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).

    The lack of rainfall in tropical countries within the Horn of Africa has worsened the issue of the already-diminished water sources from unusually warm air temperatures that dehydrated the soil and evaporated much of the existing water supply.  Tropical countries within the Horn of Africa typically have two rainy seasons: the “short” rains from October to December (abbreviated to OND) and the “long” rains from March to May (MAM). The rainy seasons have been substantially lighter than normal, with the 2020 and 2021 OND rainfall substantially below normal and the 2022 MAM season receiving the lowest rainfall on record for much of the season. 

    The drought strikes at a particularly inopportune time, as the region has still not fully recovered from a deep drought from 2016-2017. Lack of crops, combined with regional conflicts, COVID-19, locusts, and the war in Ukraine have led to spikes in the prices of basic commodities as well as a general overall shortage of necessary supplies. The ultimate result of this is that an estimated 18-21 million people in the area now face “high levels of acute food insecurity” according to the Food Security and Nutrition Working Group.

    As East Africa is particularly drought prone, FEWS NET, in conjunction with related agriculture and climate teams, invests significant research and modeling time into predicting rainfall patterns. The current drought is considered to be a toxic combination of human-induced climate warming in the western Pacific and a likely third year of La Niña conditions, the latter of which disrupts weather patterns globally.  

    Predictions for the upcoming short rain season are equally discouraging. In a forecast released on August 16, the FEWS NET agroclimatology team stated that sea surface temperature predictions indicate a likely continuation of the drought. With a high probability of “strong Indian Ocean Dipole and West Pacific Gradient conditions, it is very likely that the eastern Horn of Africa will experience very poor rains and very dry soil moisture and streamflow conditions in October-November-December.” The result of this would be a fifth season of drought, adding further stress on an already-jeopardized region.

    The map shown here, based on a data analysis by FEWS NET, shows the current levels of [food insecurity](https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/faoitaly/documents/pdf/pdf_Food_Security_Cocept_Note.pdf) across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. To describe the degree of insecurity, FEWS NET analysts use the [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification](https://fews.net/sectors-topics/approach/integrated-phase-classification), which is a standard used by the humanitarian assistance community.
    
    Another failed rainy season in late 2022 could push the region closer to catastrophe. According to the Food Security and Nutrition Working Group, more than 560,000 children were treated for severe malnutrition between January and June 2022. If conditions continue to decline, 23 million to 26 million people could face high levels of acute food insecurity by February 2023, and 6.5 million children are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition.

   The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) was created in 1985 by the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security) (USAID). FEWS NET assembles global and regional analyses of food security (particularly conditions for farming and livestock husbandry) to help governments and relief agencies plan for and respond to humanitarian crises. Several U.S. agencies support FEWS NET; NASA provides satellite imagery and climate, weather, and hydrologic data.
