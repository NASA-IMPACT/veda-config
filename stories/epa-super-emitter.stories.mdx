        ## Advanced Technology to Detect Methane “Super Emitters” from Oil and Natural Gas Operations
        In three overpasses during the winter of 2015-16, the Hyperion imaging instrument on NASA’s Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite detected methane emissions from a months-long accidental release at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility just north of Los Angeles. The satellite observations were consistent with aircraft-based methane observations from NASA’s Airborne/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument. It was the first time that methane emissions from an individual facility had been observed from space – and it marked the beginning of a wave of innovation in remote-sensing methane detection technologies that can provide actionable data.

        Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is leveraging those innovations through a new program designed to identify abnormally large methane emissions from oil and natural gas facilities for prompt investigation.

                This image pair shows a comparison of detected methane plumes over Aliso Canyon, California, acquired 11 days apart in Jan. 2016 by: (left) NASA's AVIRIS instrument on a NASA ER-2 aircraft at 4.1 miles (6.6 kilometers) altitude and (right) by the Hyperion instrument on NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite in low-Earth orbit. The additional red streaks visible in the EO-1 Hyperion image result from measurement noise -- Hyperion was not specifically designed for methane sensing and is not as sensitive as AVIRIS-NG.

        These large methane emissions events are commonly called “super emitters.” They can result from planned maintenance or other routine operations but are frequently caused by improperly operating control devices or malfunctions. Leaking equipment, hatches left open on storage tanks, and malfunctioning flares and other devices all can cause super emitters.

        Recent studies have found that as much as 50% of the methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations in the U.S. come from a small number of high-emitting sources. These events can be intermittent and can occur at any site, which makes it difficult both to predict them – and to detect them through regular monitoring surveys using traditional leak detection equipment such as optical gas imaging or hand-held flame ion detectors known as “sniffers.”

        Advanced remote-sensing technologies are making super-emitters easier to find. So, as part of its recent [rule to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/08/2024-00366/standards-of-performance-for-new-reconstructed-and-modified-sources-and-emissions-guidelines-for), the EPA established a program specifically designed to help identify these events and quickly notify owners and operators. Under the new Super Emitter Program, technology providers may apply to the EPA to have their remote methane detection technologies approved for use in the program. These include technologies that can be carried on satellites and mobile platforms, such as drones, aircraft, and other vehicles.  

        Separately, independent third parties may seek EPA certification to use the approved technologies to identify potential super emitters, which the agency has defined as methane leaks or releases with an emissions rate of 100 kilograms per hour or higher, and report those to the EPA, along with required information related to the event.
        
        Certified third parties will have a maximum of 15 days after detecting a super-emitter event to report it to the EPA. After reviewing the report for completeness and accuracy, the EPA will notify the owner/operator, who must begin required investigations within five days. These investigations would normally include reviewing maintenance activities, reviewing control device monitoring data, and screening the entire site with traditional leak detection methods. Owners/operators must report the result of their investigations to the EPA within 15 days of receiving the notification. If the source of the emissions is covered by emissions control requirements under the EPA’s “methane rule,” owners/operators must take steps to mitigate the emissions. The EPA will post super-emitter reports on its [Super Emitter website](https://www.epa.gov/compliance/methane-super-emitter-program-owners-operators).
