  ## Introduction
  <mark>üöß This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! üöß</mark>
  
  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Centers are currently experiencing heavy downpours, heatwaves and coastal flooding, and these are expected to increase in the coming decades due to climate variability and change. The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) 2009 Climate Impacts Report concluded that ‚Äúhuman-induced climate change is happening now, the impacts are already apparent, and greater impacts are projected, particularly if [greenhouse] gas emissions continue unabated.‚Äù

  The EIS team integrates the Noah-MP land surface model within [NASA‚Äôs LIS framework](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and Earth observations by assimilating soil moisture from the Climate Change Initiative Program released by European Space Agency  ([ESA CCI](https://esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/)), leaf area index from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd15a2hv006/)), and terrestrial water storage anomalies from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and the follow-on satellites ([GRACE/GRACE-FO](https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/geo/data/grace-mascons)). Using this data assimilation approach, the team provides a daily global water cycle reanalysis product for 2003-2021 at a 10 km spatial resolution. This allows us to better quantify surface variables and groundwater, human management influence, and hydrological extremes. These resulting reanalysis datasets are publicly available and interactable via this NASA VEDA platform, including key water, energy, and carbon fluxes such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) and gross primary production (GPP). For more information, please visit the corresponding [VEDA dataset page](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/data-catalog?taxonomy=%7B%22Topics%22%3A%22eis%22%7D).

    ### Using satellite data to study soil moisture dynamics
	The soil moisture percentile was caluclated from 25 different ensembles and an example of spreading of soil moisture is shown in the snapshot to understand the difference betweent he different percentiles.
