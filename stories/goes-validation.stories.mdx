description: "Results of a new experiment show technology aboard NOAA’s GOES satellites can help scientists better detect emissions of methane – a potent greenhouse gas – as often as every seven seconds. This will provide faster, more complete data on the location and amount of methane emissions to enable more rapid and successful mitigation efforts."
