    ### Introduction
    When Hurricane Ida barreled through the Gulf Coast in August 2021 as a Category 4 hurricane, it left a trail of destruction in its wake, devastating communities and reshaping landscapes. While much of the focus has been on the immediate impacts (e.g. flooded homes, downed power lines, and displaced families) there’s a quieter, yet equally important story to be told: the damage inflicted on the region’s wetlands and salt marshes. These coastal ecosystems play a pivotal role in shielding inland areas from the worst effects of hurricanes. As was with Ida, when these natural barriers are compromised, the consequences can ripple far inland, threatening lives, property, and livelihoods.

    Some of the data used in this story includes Planet’s PlanetScope satellites and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) salt marsh dataset to analyze salt marshes prior to Hurricane Ida and predict the changes to the salt marsh coverage using a supervised classification technique. A supervised classification allows us to select training samples in an image and classify an image based on the training samples that we chose. However, we can utilize PlanetScope to analyze variables such a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to determine where the greatest changes occur to vegetation health and water content.


    ### The Role of Wetlands in Coastal Protection

   Wetlands and salt marshes are nature’s first line of defense against hurricanes. Acting as sponges, these ecosystems absorb the brunt of storm surges, dissipating wave energy and reducing the force with which water hits the shore. They also help in trapping sediments, stabilizing shorelines, and providing a critical buffer that protects inland areas from flooding. The dense vegetation found in salt marshes, such as Spartina alterniflora, not only slows down water but also strengthens the soil, reducing erosion.

   However, when hurricanes as catastrophic as Ida occur, the very ecosystems designed to protect us can be severely damaged. High winds, storm surges, and saltwater intrusion can lead to the destruction of vegetation, the erosion of soil, and the alteration of these landscapes. This degradation doesn’t just impact the environment, it leaves coastal and even inland communities more vulnerable to future storms.

   ### Hurricane Ida’s Impact on Louisiana’s Salt Marshes

   Hurricane Ida provided a stark example of the destructive potential of hurricanes on wetlands. In southern Louisiana, where salt marshes are abundant, the storm’s powerful surge and high winds led to significant erosion and vegetation loss. Satellite imagery and supervised classification techniques revealed substantial declines in vegetation health, with areas like Port Fourchon and Houma witnessing the breakdown of marshes that had once served as natural flood defenses.

   The consequences of this ecological damage are far-reaching. As the marshes break down, the inland areas they once protected are left exposed to higher risks of flooding and storm surges. This not only increases the likelihood of property damage but also endangers lives in these communities. Moreover, the economic impact is profound, both in terms of cost of rebuilding and the loss of ecosystem services that these wetlands provide.

   ### The Ripple Effect: From Coastal to Inland Vulnerability
   
   The destruction of wetlands and salt marshes has a domino effect on inland communities. Without these natural barriers, storm surges can penetrate further inland, exacerbating the severity of flooding. This was evident in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, where areas that had previously been shielded by healthy wetlands experienced unprecedented flooding. Furthermore, as climate change continues to drive more intense and frequent hurricanes, the degradation of these protective ecosystems could lead to a vicious cycle of increased vulnerability and more severe impacts. The loss of wetlands not only removes a critical line of defense but also diminishes the region’s ability to recover from future storms.

    ### Using Satellite Data to Study Aerosol Optical Depth

    With a focus on the Houston, Texas metropolitan area, satellite data from the MODIS Terra and Aqua instruments were used to showcase changes in emissions over the last 20 years. While changes in AOD are subtle across the entire metropolitan area, notable differences are observed in areas with the greatest change in urbanization.

    ### Aerosol Optical Depth Compared to Houston Urbanization

    Temporal averages of AOD concentrations from 2000-2009 and 2010-2019 are used to infer insights in the changes in air quality for Houston, TX. Comparing the differences of these two time periods indicates that as the city limits have expanded over the last 20 years, AOD has increased along the leading edge of urban growth (Figure 3). As population grows in these regions, emissions from human activity typically increase resulting in higher aerosol concentrations and lower air quality. Alternatively, areas with little urban growth over the last 20 years do not show significant changes in aerosol concentrations. Note that while AOD changes in these areas are not significant, this does not necessarily mean that these areas have good air quality. For example, the area around the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) has high aerosol concentrations for the entire 20-year observational period associated with air traffic (scroll down for further analysis). AOD near Galveston Bay and along the Gulf Coast show a significant reduction in the aerosol concentrations potentially relating back to implementation of NAAQS (see current NAAQS table). Air quality standards for Sulfur Dioxide took effect in 2010 while Ozone and Particle Pollution took effect in December 2015 and could be reflected in decadally-averaged AOD measurements for 2010-2019. Using AOD measurements with socioeconomic data provides insights about how air quality has changed over the last 20 years and how different communities are affected by these changes.
