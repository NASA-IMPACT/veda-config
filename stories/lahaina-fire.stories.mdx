    ## Introduction
    On August 8, 2023, a devastating wildfire roared through the city of Lahaina, Hawai’i, located on the island of Maui and home to over 13,000 residents. This wildfire was reportedly sparked by a downed powerline on Lahainaluna Road. Though initially extinguished, the fire was reinvigorated by intense wind gusts that prevailed throughout the day. The National Weather Service reported wind gusts as high as 67 mph in the area, which helped to quickly spread the wildfire across much of Lahaina during the afternoon hours of August 8.

    A primary driver for the Lahaina Fire was a strong [gap wind](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gap_wind) that developed between the islands of Maui and Molokai. A gap wind is “a strong, low-level wind through either a relatively level channel between two mountain ranges or a gap in a mountain barrier” (reference to Glossary of meteorology). The intense winds funneling between the two islands were aided by a sharp pressure gradient caused by [Hurricane Dora](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/worldview/worldview-image-archive/hurricane-dora-6-aug-2023&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1698703849605505&usg=AOvVaw2v_a0o1c-R2PBY6AQEbNrB), a Category 4 hurricane that was approximately 500 miles south of the islands when the fire ignited. The strong gap wind persisted from August 7 to 9 and led to a rapid expansion of the fire front. What started as a small brush fire grew quickly and subsequently burned much of Lahaina.
    
    According to the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 2,170 acres were burned by the Lahaina Fire, destroying 2,207 structures—86% of which were residential buildings. The fire is estimated to have caused $5.52 billion in damages, and 97 fatalities have been confirmed as a direct result of the fire. The Lahaina Fire now ranks as the deadliest U.S. wildfire since 1918. Severe drought conditions on Maui were present leading up to the wildfire—the worst drought conditions in the entire Hawaiian Island chain. Additionally, Maui is more prone to experiencing drought conditions than the rest of the Hawaiian Islands, in part due to the mountainous portion of the island blocking the passage of westward-propagating precipitation events. These drought conditions supported the amount of dry fuel the Lahaina Fire had access to when it raged across fields and into the city.

    ## Satellite Analysis of the Lahaina Wildfire
    Thermal imagery acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensors (TIRS) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat-8 satellite detected ongoing fires across much of the city of Lahaina during its overpass at 10:35 p.m., Local Standard Time, on August 8. TIRS and OLI take observations from several different wavelengths that can be used to better understand changes to land and vegetation from natural disasters. With a simple calculation using two wavelength bands, scientists can derive burned area from satellite observations. Burned area derived using NASA’s Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) products on August 13, 2023, clearly show areas most impacted by the fire. The areas identified with the highest probability of having been burned were located across the severely scorched fields just uphill from the city. 

    Another technique scientists use to identify the impacts of natural disasters are false-color composite images. False-color composite imagery replaces the traditional red, green, and blue wavelength bands that correspond to how our eyes see with other wavelength bands. Fires are particularly sensitive to the near infrared (IR) and shortwave IR wavelengths. When the red, green, and blue bands are replaced with the shortwave IR, near IR, and red bands, respectively, land areas most impacted by the fire are much darker in the image than unaffected areas.
