    ### Introduction
    The Houston metropolitan area is the fourth most populous city in the United States and top-10 in terms of spatial extent. It’s well known that the impact cities can have on the surrounding environment correlates with the architectural characteristics and spatial extent of the city. Houston’s notably large spatial extent and high population pave the way for high levels of human-produced emissions within its transportation infrastructure. These emissions and its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, make Houston especially susceptible to environmental changes related to urban development.

    A team of researchers from the University of Alabama in Huntsville temporally averaged daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua satellites to evaluate decadal changes in AOD over the Houston metropolitan area. MODIS-derived AOD is the measure of aerosols (e.g. urban haze, smoke particles, dust, sea salt) distributed within a column of air from the space-based instrument to Earth's surface (adapted from NASA's Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) definition). From an observer on the ground, an AOD of less than 0.1 is characteristic of a clear sky, bright Sun, and maximum visibility. As AOD increases to 0.5, 1.0, and greater than 3.0, aerosols become so dense that the Sun is obscured. The team also utilizes urbanization data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Imperviousness dataset to visualize how Houston’s urban footprint has changed between 2001 and 2019. The combination of these data with socioeconomic data from NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) poverty level allow for insights on how urban growth in Houston impacted air quality and how those changes can vary by socioeconomic status (Dataset landing pages below).

    ### Air Quality and AOD

   Aerosols can have a variety of implications for the general public. In terms of air quality, aerosols can affect the air quality with high concentrations of pollutants that may pose a risk to public health. The highest risk comes from power plants where the level of emissions are the highest. In-situ measurements of aerosol concentrations, measurements taken at a fixed location, coupled with global satellite observations help scientists study air quality. AOD measured by the MODIS Terra and Aqua instruments is available globally every 1-2 days and aids researchers identify trends in aerosol concentrations to help inform decision makers.

   In recent years, pollution sources have been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which has found ways to reduce the amount of emissions. The EPA established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to regulate emissions to better protect public health. The NAAQS included in the Clean Air Act provides regulation of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide among others.

    ### Using Satellite Data to Study Aerosol Optical Depth

    With a focus on the Houston, Texas metropolitan area, satellite data from the MODIS Terra and Aqua instruments were used to showcase changes in emissions over the last 20 years. While changes in AOD are subtle across the entire metropolitan area, notable differences are observed in areas with the greatest change in urbanization.

    ### Aerosol Optical Depth Compared to Houston Urbanization

    Temporal averages of AOD concentrations from 2000-2009 and 2010-2019 are used to infer insights in the changes in air quality for Houston, TX. Comparing the differences of these two time periods indicates that as the city limits have expanded over the last 20 years, AOD has increased along the leading edge of urban growth (Figure 3). As population grows in these regions, emissions from human activity typically increase resulting in higher aerosol concentrations and lower air quality. Alternatively, areas with little urban growth over the last 20 years do not show significant changes in aerosol concentrations. Note that while AOD changes in these areas are not significant, this does not necessarily mean that these areas have good air quality. For example, the area around the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) has high aerosol concentrations for the entire 20-year observational period associated with air traffic (scroll down for further analysis). AOD near Galveston Bay and along the Gulf Coast show a significant reduction in the aerosol concentrations potentially relating back to implementation of NAAQS (see current NAAQS table). Air quality standards for Sulfur Dioxide took effect in 2010 while Ozone and Particle Pollution took effect in December 2015 and could be reflected in decadally-averaged AOD measurements for 2010-2019. Using AOD measurements with socioeconomic data provides insights about how air quality has changed over the last 20 years and how different communities are affected by these changes.

    ## AOD Time series for Galveston Bay
    The monthly and spatially averaged time series of AOD for Galveston Bay (just east of downtown Houston) show a statistically significant (p < 0.005) decreasing trend in AOD from 2000 to 2019. Note the measure of statistical significance of p < 0.005 indicates that there is very high confidence the decreasing trend in AOD is real and not due to chance. This decreasing trend in AOD could potentially be attributed to air quality regulations implemented as a part of the Clean Air Act between 2010 and 2019.

    ## AOD Time series for Western Houston
    Unlike the Galveston Bay area, the monthly and spatially averaged time series of AOD for the Western Suburbs of Houston, TX shows a trend where there is a small, statistically insignificant increase over the time period of 2000 to 2019. Note that the spatial pattern of difference in decadal mean AOD between the second and first decade of this century shows a localized increase that correlates to urbanization. The small increase in AOD concentrations could be potentially explained by vehicular and other urban sources of pollution counteracting the effects of the Clean Air Act.

    ## AOD Timseries for IAH
    Over a 20-year observational period from 2000 to 2019, the area around George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston maintained high aerosol concentrations, possibly due to air traffic. Consistently high aerosol concentrations in this region serve as a good example that changes in AOD do not correlate to air quality directly.
