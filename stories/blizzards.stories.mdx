  ### Introduction

  Blizzards are extreme winter weather events defined by the National Weather Service (NWS) as a combination of heavy falling or blowing snow, strong winds sustained at 35 mph or higher, and reduced visibility (less than a quarter of a mile) lasting for at least three contiguous hours. These powerful storms can bring everyday life to a standstill by disrupting travel, damaging infrastructure, and exposing people and animals to dangerous elements.

  In the United States, blizzards occur most frequently in the northern Great Plains, but they have been reported in every state except Hawaii. While blizzards are traditionally associated with winter, records show they can happen any time between October and June. Advances in weather monitoring and forecasting have improved our ability to detect and report these events, which has led to an increase in reported blizzard activity over the past several decades. [On average, 13 blizzards occur annually across CONUS, but the past few decades have seen this number inflate to 19](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b98f7bd1758e4cc271d365/t/5c5b279c24a69469aa5a4d44/1549477788244/Colemanandschwartz.pdf&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1738269695252270&usg=AOvVaw2G74skUn4wS7sPosLCLuF8). The geographic spread of these storms has also widened, with more blizzards occurring outside their historical hotspots. Although the intensity of impact by individual storms has generally decreased due to better forecasting, their economic and societal impacts have risen, with associated losses now exceeding $1 billion per year. Understanding blizzards and preparing for their impacts is critical for communities in regions prone to extreme winter weather.

  ### Climatology of Blizzards

  In the United States, blizzards predominantly affect a region often referred to as "Blizzard Alley‚Äù, encompassing parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming, and eastern Colorado. The flat terrain and scarcity of natural windbreaks, such as forests or mountains, allow cold Arctic air masses to sweep down from Canada unimpeded, leading to frequent blizzard conditions, far more than any other region in the country. 
      
  Several key factors contribute to the high frequency of blizzards in this region:
  * Flat Topography: The expansive Great Plains offer little resistance to wind, enabling strong gusts to develop and sustain.
  * Lack of Vegetation: The absence of significant tree cover means there are few obstacles to slow down or block wind flow.
  * Proximity to Arctic Air Masses: The region's location allows cold air from the Arctic to move southward easily, interacting with moist air masses to produce snow.
  * Frequent Storm Systems: Low-pressure systems often develop east of the Rocky Mountains, intensifying as they move into the Plains, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds.

  While Blizzard Alley is the most blizzard-prone area, other parts of the United States also experience these severe storms: The Northeastern U.S. is known as a secondary Blizzard Alley, as this region frequently experiences nor'easters‚Äîpowerful storms that can produce blizzard conditions. Additionally, the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains is susceptible to blizzards due to storm systems intensifying as they descend from higher elevations.
