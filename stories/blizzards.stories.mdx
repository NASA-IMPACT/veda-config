  ### Introduction

  Blizzards are extreme winter weather events defined by the National Weather Service (NWS) as a combination of heavy falling or blowing snow, strong winds sustained at 35 mph or higher, and reduced visibility (less than a quarter of a mile) lasting for at least three contiguous hours. These powerful storms can bring everyday life to a standstill by disrupting travel, damaging infrastructure, and exposing people and animals to dangerous elements.

  In the United States, blizzards occur most frequently in the northern Great Plains, but they have been reported in every state except Hawaii. While blizzards are traditionally associated with winter, records show they can happen any time between October and June. Advances in weather monitoring and forecasting have improved our ability to detect and report these events, which has led to an increase in reported blizzard activity over the past several decades. [On average, 13 blizzards occur annually across CONUS, but the past few decades have seen this number inflate to 19](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b98f7bd1758e4cc271d365/t/5c5b279c24a69469aa5a4d44/1549477788244/Colemanandschwartz.pdf&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1738269695252270&usg=AOvVaw2G74skUn4wS7sPosLCLuF8). The geographic spread of these storms has also widened, with more blizzards occurring outside their historical hotspots. Although the intensity of impact by individual storms has generally decreased due to better forecasting, their economic and societal impacts have risen, with associated losses now exceeding $1 billion per year. Understanding blizzards and preparing for their impacts is critical for communities in regions prone to extreme winter weather.

  ### Climatology of Blizzards

  In the United States, blizzards predominantly affect a region often referred to as "Blizzard Alley‚Äù, encompassing parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming, and eastern Colorado. The flat terrain and scarcity of natural windbreaks, such as forests or mountains, allow cold Arctic air masses to sweep down from Canada unimpeded, leading to frequent blizzard conditions, far more than any other region in the country. 
      
  Several key factors contribute to the high frequency of blizzards in this region:
  * Flat Topography: The expansive Great Plains offer little resistance to wind, enabling strong gusts to develop and sustain.
  * Lack of Vegetation: The absence of significant tree cover means there are few obstacles to slow down or block wind flow.
  * Proximity to Arctic Air Masses: The region's location allows cold air from the Arctic to move southward easily, interacting with moist air masses to produce snow.
  * Frequent Storm Systems: Low-pressure systems often develop east of the Rocky Mountains, intensifying as they move into the Plains, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds.

  While Blizzard Alley is the most blizzard-prone area, other parts of the United States also experience these severe storms: The Northeastern U.S. is known as a secondary Blizzard Alley, as this region frequently experiences nor'easters‚Äîpowerful storms that can produce blizzard conditions. Additionally, the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains is susceptible to blizzards due to storm systems intensifying as they descend from higher elevations.

  ### Meteorology of Blizzards

  #### Miller Types A and B

  Winter storms in the United States are often associated with two types of cyclones, classified as Miller Type A and Miller Type B, based on their formation and evolution. These storm types describe the pathways and interactions of low-pressure systems that can bring heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions to different regions of the country.

  ##### ***Miller Type A Cyclones***

  Miller Type A cyclones form along the Gulf Coast or in the southern United States, where warm, moist air from the Gulf of America meets colder Arctic air descending from the north. These storms then travel along the East Coast, often intensifying as they near the Northeast U.S., as they tap into additional moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. Type A cyclones tend to bring widespread, heavy snowfall to the densely populated I-95 corridor or interior Northeast. Their direct development along the Gulf provides an abundant moisture source, resulting in potentially significant impacts for the Southeastern U.S., the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast.

  ##### ***Miller Type B Cyclones***

  Miller Type B cyclones are more complex, involving the interaction of two distinct low pressure systems. A primary low forms over the Midwest or Great Lakes regions, often producing light to moderate snowfall. As the primary low weakens, energy transfers to a secondary low-pressure system that develops near the Mid-Atlantic coast. This secondary low rapidly intensifies as it moves up the East Coast, often producing heavy snow for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Type B cyclones tend to bring mixed precipitation and ice to areas farther inland before transitioning to snow along the coast.

  ##### ***Nor'easters***

  Nor‚Äôeasters are perhaps the most notorious system that can bring blizzard conditions. Nor‚Äôeasters frequent blizzard conditions to the I-95 corridor, can be either Miller Type A or B cyclones (but are more commonly Type B), and are often tracked using a coordinate benchmark known as the "40¬∞N, 70¬∞W rule." This location, just southeast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, serves as a critical reference point for meteorologists. If the center of a nor‚Äôeaster passes near or over this benchmark as it moves to the northeast, it frequently results in significant snow and wind impacts for the densely populated I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston. This position aligns the storm to draw in cold Arctic air from the northwest while tapping into moist Atlantic air, creating the perfect setup for heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions.

  A defining feature of many nor‚Äôeasters is bomb cyclogenesis, or "bombogenesis", which occurs when a storm's central low pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, signifying rapid intensification of the system. The process is driven by the clash of cold air from the north and warm, humid air over the Atlantic. As the storm deepens, powerful winds spiral inward towards the central low pressure, enhancing snowfall rates and creating whiteout conditions. Bomb cyclogenesis often results in some of the most impactful nor‚Äôeasters, which have been historically responsible for bringing record-breaking snowfall and hurricane-force winds to parts of the Northeast.
