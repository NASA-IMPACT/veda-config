  ### Introduction

  Blizzards are extreme winter weather events defined by the National Weather Service (NWS) as a combination of heavy falling or blowing snow, strong winds sustained at 35 mph or higher, and reduced visibility (less than a quarter of a mile) lasting for at least three contiguous hours. These powerful storms can bring everyday life to a standstill by disrupting travel, damaging infrastructure, and exposing people and animals to dangerous elements.

  In the United States, blizzards occur most frequently in the northern Great Plains, but they have been reported in every state except Hawaii. While blizzards are traditionally associated with winter, records show they can happen any time between October and June. Advances in weather monitoring and forecasting have improved our ability to detect and report these events, which has led to an increase in reported blizzard activity over the past several decades. [On average, 13 blizzards occur annually across CONUS, but the past few decades have seen this number inflate to 19](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b98f7bd1758e4cc271d365/t/5c5b279c24a69469aa5a4d44/1549477788244/Colemanandschwartz.pdf&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1738269695252270&usg=AOvVaw2G74skUn4wS7sPosLCLuF8). The geographic spread of these storms has also widened, with more blizzards occurring outside their historical hotspots. Although the intensity of impact by individual storms has generally decreased due to better forecasting, their economic and societal impacts have risen, with associated losses now exceeding $1 billion per year. Understanding blizzards and preparing for their impacts is critical for communities in regions prone to extreme winter weather.

  ### Climatology of Blizzards

  In the United States, blizzards predominantly affect a region often referred to as "Blizzard Alley‚Äù, encompassing parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming, and eastern Colorado. The flat terrain and scarcity of natural windbreaks, such as forests or mountains, allow cold Arctic air masses to sweep down from Canada unimpeded, leading to frequent blizzard conditions, far more than any other region in the country. 
      
  Several key factors contribute to the high frequency of blizzards in this region:
  * Flat Topography: The expansive Great Plains offer little resistance to wind, enabling strong gusts to develop and sustain.
  * Lack of Vegetation: The absence of significant tree cover means there are few obstacles to slow down or block wind flow.
  * Proximity to Arctic Air Masses: The region's location allows cold air from the Arctic to move southward easily, interacting with moist air masses to produce snow.
  * Frequent Storm Systems: Low-pressure systems often develop east of the Rocky Mountains, intensifying as they move into the Plains, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds.

  While Blizzard Alley is the most blizzard-prone area, other parts of the United States also experience these severe storms: The Northeastern U.S. is known as a secondary Blizzard Alley, as this region frequently experiences nor'easters‚Äîpowerful storms that can produce blizzard conditions. Additionally, the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains is susceptible to blizzards due to storm systems intensifying as they descend from higher elevations.

  ### Meteorology of Blizzards

  #### Miller Types A and B

  Winter storms in the United States are often associated with two types of cyclones, classified as Miller Type A and Miller Type B, based on their formation and evolution. These storm types describe the pathways and interactions of low-pressure systems that can bring heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions to different regions of the country.

  ##### ***Miller Type A Cyclones***

  Miller Type A cyclones form along the Gulf Coast or in the southern United States, where warm, moist air from the Gulf of America meets colder Arctic air descending from the north. These storms then travel along the East Coast, often intensifying as they near the Northeast U.S., as they tap into additional moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. Type A cyclones tend to bring widespread, heavy snowfall to the densely populated I-95 corridor or interior Northeast. Their direct development along the Gulf provides an abundant moisture source, resulting in potentially significant impacts for the Southeastern U.S., the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast.

  ##### ***Miller Type B Cyclones***

  Miller Type B cyclones are more complex, involving the interaction of two distinct low pressure systems. A primary low forms over the Midwest or Great Lakes regions, often producing light to moderate snowfall. As the primary low weakens, energy transfers to a secondary low-pressure system that develops near the Mid-Atlantic coast. This secondary low rapidly intensifies as it moves up the East Coast, often producing heavy snow for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Type B cyclones tend to bring mixed precipitation and ice to areas farther inland before transitioning to snow along the coast.

  ##### ***Nor'easters***

  Nor‚Äôeasters are perhaps the most notorious system that can bring blizzard conditions. Nor‚Äôeasters frequent blizzard conditions to the I-95 corridor, can be either Miller Type A or B cyclones (but are more commonly Type B), and are often tracked using a coordinate benchmark known as the "40¬∞N, 70¬∞W rule." This location, just southeast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, serves as a critical reference point for meteorologists. If the center of a nor‚Äôeaster passes near or over this benchmark as it moves to the northeast, it frequently results in significant snow and wind impacts for the densely populated I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston. This position aligns the storm to draw in cold Arctic air from the northwest while tapping into moist Atlantic air, creating the perfect setup for heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions.

  A defining feature of many nor‚Äôeasters is bomb cyclogenesis, or "bombogenesis", which occurs when a storm's central low pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, signifying rapid intensification of the system. The process is driven by the clash of cold air from the north and warm, humid air over the Atlantic. As the storm deepens, powerful winds spiral inward towards the central low pressure, enhancing snowfall rates and creating whiteout conditions. Bomb cyclogenesis often results in some of the most impactful nor‚Äôeasters, which have been historically responsible for bringing record-breaking snowfall and hurricane-force winds to parts of the Northeast.

  ##### ***Colorado/Denver Cyclones***

  Denver Cyclones, or Colorado Cyclones, are low pressure systems that form on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains, often along the Colorado Front Range. These systems form when moist air from the Gulf of America converges with cold Arctic air descending from Canada, creating sharp temperature gradients. The interaction between these air masses and the region‚Äôs complex terrain promotes the development of cyclonic systems that can bring heavy snowfall or blizzard conditions to the Colorado Front Range, including Denver, as well as parts of the Central and Northern Great Plains and Midwest. As these cyclones intensify and move eastward, they can bring severe winter weather to Blizzard Alley, making them a key contributor to the high frequency of blizzards in this region. The open terrain of the Great Plains amplifies wind speeds, further reducing visibility and exacerbating blizzard conditions.

    datetime='2024-05-31'
  >
    
  A critical factor in the formation of Denver cyclones is the Denver Cyclone Vorticity Zone (DCVZ)‚Äîa mesoscale atmospheric feature unique to the area. The DCVZ forms due to easterly upslope winds interacting with the Rocky Mountains, creating a zone of cyclonic rotation just east of Denver. This zone can serve as a focal point for the development or intensification of low pressure systems, often enhancing snowfall near Denver and the eastern Colorado Plains. This enhancement of snowfall often carries eastward as the storm moves into the Great Plains, but typically weakens by the time it reaches the Midwest (though there have been a few notable blizzards in the Midwest that can be attributed to Denver Cyclones).

  ##### ***Panhandle Hookers***

  Panhandle Hookers are another type of low pressure system that can bring blizzard conditions to portions of CONUS. These cyclones originate in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and are known for their distinctive ‚Äòhooking‚Äô storm track - hence their unique name. These systems typically form when a strong blast of cold Arctic air from the north (known as Blue Northers) collides with warm, moist air from the Gulf of America in the southern Plains. As the storm intensifies, it takes a northeastward "hook-shaped" trajectory, moving across the central Plains, the Midwest, and into the Great Lakes region. Panhandle Hookers most often bring heavy snow and blizzard conditions to parts of the central Great Plains, Upper Midwest, and Great Lakes, while the southern Plains and Ohio Valley may experience mixed precipitation or severe weather on the warmer side of the storm. These systems are a major source of snow for the central United States and, depending on their exact track, can also more uncommonly impact the northeastern U.S. with snow or ice. The strong winds and rapid intensification of these storms make them a hallmark of winter weather in the Plains and Midwest.

  ##### ***Alberta Clippers, Saskatchewan Screamers, and Manitoba Maulers***

  Alberta Clippers, Saskatchewan Screamers, and Manitoba Maulers are fast-moving low pressure systems that originate in the Canadian Prairies and bring cold, dry air and light to moderate snowfall to parts of the United States. These systems are named for their origins in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, respectively, and are distinguished by their speed and limited moisture content. Alberta Clippers are the most common of the three and typically travel southeastward across the northern Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes region, often bringing light amounts of snow, though localized areas can receive higher totals. Saskatchewan Screamers and Manitoba Maulers follow similar tracks but are less frequent. Due to their rapid movement, these storms rarely bring heavy snowfall, but their strong winds can create blowing snow and reduced visibility, occasionally leading to blizzard conditions. Additionally, they often usher in frigid Arctic air, leading to significant temperature drops that can be anomalous for impacted regions. These systems are a defining feature of winter weather across the northern United States and contribute heavily to the region's cold and snowy climatology, as in more active years handfuls of these systems can occur in quick succession.

  #### ***The Great Appalachian Storm of 1950 (Snow Bowl Blizzard)***

  The Great Appalachian Blizzard of 1950 is remembered as one of the most extraordinary and impactful winter storms in U.S. history. Occurring over Thanksgiving weekend, from November 24 to 30, the storm wreaked havoc across 22 states, bringing record snowfall, hurricane-force winds, and freezing temperatures. Snowfall totals reached unprecedented levels, with Coburn Creek, West Virginia, reporting 62 inches, and widespread accumulations exceeding 30 inches across parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Accompanying winds gusted up to 110 mph in Concord, New Hampshire, and 160 mph at Mount Washington, causing severe damage and widespread power outages. In total, the storm claimed 353 lives and caused an estimated $66.7 million in damages (equivalent to about $845 million today).

  #### ***The Great Appalachian Storm of 1950 (Snow Bowl Blizzard)***

  A notable event during this historic blizzard was the infamous ‚ÄòSnow Bowl‚Äô. The Snow Bowl was the  annual edition of ‚ÄòThe Game‚Äô - the Ohio State-Michigan football game, played on November 25 in Columbus, Ohio. Under heavy snowfall and freezing winds, players and fans braved the elements as snowplows were used to clear the field mid-game. The extreme weather rendered passing nearly impossible, and Michigan was able to pull out a 9-3 win. This edition of ‚ÄòThe Game‚Äô remains one of the most memorable contests ever played in all of collegiate athletics.

  The societal impact of the 1950 blizzard is highlighted quite well by its ranking as the second-highest storm on the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI), a NOAA metric that measures the effects of major snowstorms based on snowfall totals, geographic area covered, and population impact. Transportation networks were paralyzed, millions were left without power, and freezing temperatures caused significant agricultural losses, especially in the southeastern U.S., where unseasonable cold destroyed crops.

  #### ***The Great Blizzard of ‚Äò78 (Cleveland Superbomb)***

  The Great Blizzard of ‚Äò78, also known as the "Cleveland Superbomb," remains one of the most catastrophic winter storms in U.S. history, and is one of the worst natural disasters to ever impact Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. Occurring from January 25 to 27, the storm developed as an intense low-pressure system surged northward from the Gulf of America, colliding with Arctic air on the heels of a small clipper system. This convergence created a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure, with Cleveland recording a barometric pressure of 28.28 inches (958 millibars)‚Äîone of the lowest ever observed in the continental United States. The rapid intensification, known as bomb cyclogenesis, led to blizzard conditions of unprecedented severity.

  Wind gusts during the storm were that of hurricane force on the east side of the low pressure system, with a boat on Lake Erie recording an impressive 111 mph gust and Cleveland experiencing gusts up to 82 mph. These winds combined with heavy snowfall to create whiteout conditions, with visibility reduced to zero in many areas. Snowfall totals ranged from 10 to 30 inches across affected states, but drifts created by the strong winds piled snow 20 to 40 feet high in some locations. These monster drifts buried cars, blocked nearly every road (including Interstate 75, trapping truckers for days), and isolating communities.
