    Hurricane season in the United States stretches from June 1 through November 30 on any particular year. Peak Hurricane season in the eastern United States occurs in August and September. In 2022, Hurricane Ian impacted southwest Florida on September 28 as a Category 4 Hurricane (based on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale). The storm produced $110 billion dollars in damage in Florida alone and left 158 dead. Hurricane Ian was also responsible for not only its impact on life and property, but also an impact on the landscape in portions of southwestern Florida near Fort Myers. Storm surge reached unprecedented levels around the regions of Cape Coral and Fort Myers upwards of 12 to 18 feet. Storm surge, in simple terms, is the sudden rise in ocean water levels during a storm such as a hurricane or tropical storm. An analysis in Figure 1 from the National Hurricane Center’s review on Hurricane Ian shows the dangerous storm surge’s heavy impact on our area of interest. The storm surge is attributed as the primary cause of the catastrophic damage on Pine and Sanibel Islands along with the coastline of Cape Coral and Fort Myers.


    ## Inland Effects of Ian
    Hurricane Ian originated  off of the Atlantic Coast of Africa and moved easterly towards the Caribbean and became “Tropical Storm Ian'' once it reached southeast of Jamaica on September 24th.. Ian then intensified into a hurricane quickly and made landfall in western Cuba near Havana as a Category 3 storm where it caused catastrophic damage and widespread power outages. After exiting  Cuba, it quickly intensified into a Category 5 Hurricane near the southwestern coast of Florida.  Ian made landfall on Cayo Costa Island as a strong Category 4 Hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 149 MPH. Ian weakened to tropical storm status further inland of the Florida Peninsula before exiting into the Atlantic. The damage from Hurricane Ian was especially catastrophic on Pine and Sanibel islands just off the coast of Cape Coral. Figure 2 represents two images from the Associated Press encompassing our primary areas of focus: Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel island and the destruction that Hurricane left in its wake. Most homes along this portion of Fort Myers beach were moved due to the storm surge and were either destroyed or severely damaged. The second image shows a section of the Sanibel Causeway (the causeway that connects Sanibel Island to the mainland of Florida) that was taken out by Hurricane Ian. Both of these images do not begin to scratch the surface on just how catastrophic Ian was not only on vegetation, but to infrastructure in the area.

    ## NDVI & Entropy Analysis

    The figure to the left depicts the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) around Cape Coral a month prior to Hurricane Ian comparing the landscape to the week after. NDVI serves as a fundamental metric for comprehending the vitality and abundance of vegetation within a specific geographical region. In this data story, we obtained NDVI data from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) that is aboard the NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and 9 satellites over two different days encompassing the area prior to the hurricane and post-hurricane. The primary vegetation in this portion of Florida can include grasslands and forested regions. In Figure 5, the darker green locations show a relatively high abundance of vegetation in a particular location. The light green or yellow locations depict areas with low vegetation meaning that these areas are likely urbanized in a location such as this. Notice Pine and Sanibel Islands just east of Cape Coral. These areas were particularly hard hit by Ian. Storm surge inundated much of the access points to the islands along with washing away much of the vegetation in these locations. The post-Ian image shows a significant change in the vegetation landscape. Note that we mentioned Pine and Sanibel Islands. Much of the vegetation seems to have been washed away by the storm surge. Punta Russa, located on the southwestern tip of Fort Myers beach along Sanibel Causeway, is another location that experienced catastrophic storm surge during Ian. Note the change in NDVI at the tip of Punta Russa. In addition to statistical analyses, the notable transformation of vegetation in these dispersed areas holds significant scientific importance, as it provides compelling evidence of the formidable impact exerted by this catastrophic hurricane.

    The next figure shows a significant change in the vegetation landscape post-Hurricane by taking the difference between pre and post-Ian NDVI. Note that we mentioned Pine and Sanibel Islands. Much of the vegetation seems to have been washed away by the storm surge. Punta Russa, located on the southwestern tip of Fort Myers beach along Sanibel Causeway, is another location that experienced catastrophic storm surge during Ian. Note that most of Sanibel island was either heavily impacted or completely inundated by the Hurricane. We also notice a heavy impact along Fort Myers beach and Punta Russa (previously mentioned).

    The pivotal takeaway from this narrative is that Hurricane Ian’s impact extended beyond human life and property, affecting vegetation. The hurricane’s storm surge inundated vast stretches of the coastline between Cape Coral and Fort Myers, but it was particularly catastrophic for Pine and Sanibel Islands. Here, a substantial portion of the pre-Ian vegetation underwent severe devastation due to the sudden surge in water. Thus, hurricanes can exert a substantial and multifaceted influence on the ecological landscape, underscoring the significance of understanding their broader environmental repercussions.

    Entropy, in the context of remote sensing and image analysis, is a measure of the randomness or disorder in an image. A high entropy value suggests a higher level of complexity and texture, while a lower value indicates uniformity and smoothness. By analyzing the entropy change associated with Hurricane Ian using our HLS datasets, we analyze alterations in surface patterns and characteristics. The observed increase in entropy in certain coastal regions post-Hurricane suggests that the once smooth and uniform beach areas become more complex in texture. This complexity could be attributed to the catastrophic storm surge that occurred in the hurricane that pushed the sand further inland. This not only altered the coastal terrain but also created a lot of disorder further inland where homes and businesses that were once present are now either destroyed or heavily damaged. The amount of sand and debris that is scattered throughout the area of interest created chaos within our entropy change from Hurricane Ian. These differences can be analyzed in the figure to the right where the areas in light to dark red represent the areas where the highest change occurred.

    ## Anomaly Detection and Damage Probability Predictions
    Using both analysis from NDVI and entropy differences, we employed anomaly detection to identify and quantify areas that underwent significant changes due to Ian’s impact. This process hinged on the utilization of z-scores, a statistical measure that denotes how many standard deviations a particular data point is from the mean of the dataset. For remote sensing, the z-score was used to highlight pixels that deviated markedly from the average behavior in the scene, indicating potential areas of change or disturbance.

    By calculating the z-scores of our data sources, we could pinpoint pixels with values that were either significantly higher or lower than expected based on the overall distribution of data. Areas with high positive z-scores represented regions where the change, whether it was in vegetation health or surface complexity, was much greater than the average change observed throughout the area of interest. Conversely, areas with high negative z-scores signified regions that were unusually stable or unchanged.

    The UCONN GERS lab’s ‘CONUS Disturbance Watcher’ offers a pioneering approach to near real-time land disturbance detection, utilizing the HLS dataset. By harnessing the capabilities of the Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD), this platform constantly updates spectral change magnitudes and other pertinent disturbance features in response to the most recent imagery. Once these features are defined, the system predicts the probability of land disturbances by leveraging models pre-trained on historical disturbance datasets. In the context of Ian, this damage probability dataset serves as a valuable complement. While our primary assessments, including entropy changes and anomaly detection, provide direct insights into Ian’s impact, the ‘CONUS Disturbance Watcher’ augments our understanding by delivering probabilistic insights into areas most likely affected by disturbances. By integrating these data, we gain a more comprehensive view of Ian’s aftermath, combining direct observation with predictive analytics to determine areas of potential vulnerability and change.

    ## Damage on the Sanibel Causeway

    The catastrophic hurricane caused the Sanibel Causeway (or the road that connects Sanibel island to the main coast of Florida) to collapse. The collapsed causeway alone depicts the power behind this hurricane and just how much of the landscape could be changed from the hurricane if it can cause a major thoroughfare such as this to take such a hit.

    ## Damage to Fort Myers

    Not only did Ian create major impacts to travel across Sanibel Island and the main coast of Florida, it also caused catastrophic damage to the main coast as well. In this image, you can see all of the homes that have either been destroyed, washed away, or completely moved off of their foundations. Not only does the storm surge wreak havoc on vegetation but can have major implications for the infrastructure aspect of the landscape. This image speaks volumes to our take home message discussing the impacts of the hurricane to infrastructure and vegetation.
