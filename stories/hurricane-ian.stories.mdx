    Hurricane season in the United States stretches from June 1 through November 30 on any particular year. Peak hurricane season in the eastern United States occurs in August and September. In 2022, Hurricane Ian impacted southwest Florida on September 28 as it made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane (based on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale). The storm produced $110 billion dollars in damage in Florida alone and left 158 dead. Hurricane Ian was also responsible for not only its impact on life and property, but also an impact on the landscape in portions of southwestern Florida near Fort Myers. Storm surge reached unprecedented levels around the regions of Cape Coral and Fort Myers upwards of 12 to 18 feet. Storm surge, in simple terms, is the sudden rise in ocean water levels during a storm such as a tropical cyclone  or other strong low pressure system. An analysis in Figure 1 from the National Hurricane Center’s review on Hurricane Ian shows the dangerous storm surge’s heavy impact on our area of interest. The storm surge is attributed as the primary cause of death along the coast of southwestern Florida.


    ## Inland Effects of Ian
    Hurricane Ian  became an official named storm southeast of Jamaica on September 24th. Ian then intensified into a hurricane quickly and made landfall in western Cuba near Havana as a Category 3 storm where it caused catastrophic damage and widespread power outages. After exiting  Cuba, it quickly intensified into a Category 5 Hurricane near the southwestern coast of Florida.  As it continued moving north and west, hurricane Ian made landfall on Cayo Costa Island as a strong Category 4 Hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 149 MPH. Ian weakened to tropical storm status further inland of the Florida Peninsula before exiting into the Atlantic. The damage from Hurricane Ian was especially catastrophic on Pine and Sanibel islands just off the coast of Cape Coral. Figure 2 represents two images from the Associated Press encompassing our primary areas of focus for this data story: Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel Island and the destruction that Hurricane Ian left in its wake. Most homes along this portion of Fort Myers beach were moved due to the storm surge and were either destroyed or severely damaged. The second image shows a section of the Sanibel Causeway (the causeway that connects Sanibel Island to the mainland of Florida) that was taken out by Hurricane Ian. Both of these images do not begin to scratch the surface on just how catastrophic Ian was not only on vegetation, but to infrastructure in the area.

    ## NDVI & Entropy Analysis

    The figure to the left depicts the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) around Cape Coral a month prior to Hurricane Ian comparing the landscape to the week after. NDVI serves as a fundamental metric for comprehending the vitality and abundance of vegetation within a specific geographical region. In this data story, we compare NDVI data from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) for two different days encompassing the area prior to the hurricane and post-hurricane. The primary vegetation in this portion of Florida can include grasslands and forested regions. In Figure 5, the darker green locations show a relatively high abundance of healthy vegetation at a particular location. The light green,yellow, and red locations depict areas with no or unhealthy vegetation. Notice Pine and Sanibel Islands just east of Cape Coral. These areas were particularly hard hit by Ian. Storm surge inundated much of the access points to the islands and washed  away much of the vegetation in these locations. The post-Ian image shows a significant change in the vegetation landscape. Much of the vegetation seems to have been damaged or removed by the storm surge. In addition to statistical analyses, the notable transformation of vegetation in these dispersed areas holds significant scientific importance, as it provides compelling evidence of the formidable impacts of this catastrophic hurricane. Here, a substantial portion of the pre-Ian vegetation underwent severe devastation due to the sudden surge in water. Hurricanes can have a big and varied impact on nature, showing why it's important to know about their wider environmental effects.

    Figure 3 shows a significant change in the vegetation landscape post-hurricane by taking the difference between pre and post-Ian NDVI. Ian caused widespread devastation in coastal areas, with many places experiencing severe damage or complete flooding. The storm surge washed away much of the natural vegetation, severely impacting local ecosystems and communities. This highlights the broader issue of the destructive power of hurricanes on natural environments near and along the coast, underscoring the need for preparedness and resilience strategies.

    Entropy, in the context of remote sensing and image analysis, is a measure of the randomness or disorder in an image. More specifically, we can see how surface textures such as vegetation and buildings were changed after the hurricane. A high entropy value suggests a higher level of complexity and texture, while a lower value indicates uniformity and smoothness. By analyzing the entropy change associated with Hurricane Ian using the same HLS data, we analyze alterations in surface patterns and characteristics. The observed increase in entropy in certain coastal regions post-hurricane suggests that the once smooth and uniform beach areas become more complex in texture. This complexity could be attributed to the catastrophic storm surge that occurred in the hurricane that pushed coastal sand further inland. This not only altered the coastal terrain but also created a lot of land surface changes further inland where homes and businesses that were once present are now either destroyed or heavily damaged. The amount of sand and debris that is scattered throughout the area of interest can be seen within our entropy change from Hurricane Ian. These differences can be analyzed in the figure to the right where the areas in light to dark red represent the areas where the highest change occurred.

    ## Damage Probability Predictions

    The UCONN GERS lab’s ‘CONUS Disturbance Watcher’ offers a pioneering approach to near real-time land disturbance detection, utilizing the HLS dataset. By harnessing the capabilities of the Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD), the dataset establishes a reference image from sustained observation of the land surface and is triggered after a natural disaster to identify  land surface disturbance features in post-event satellite imagery. Once these features are defined, the system predicts the damage probability by comparing against the reference image for a given location. In the context of Hurricane Ian, this damage probability dataset serves as a valuable complement to evaluating vegetation and coastline changes associated with wind and storm surge. While our primary assessments, including entropy changes, provide direct insights into Ian’s impact, the ‘CONUS Disturbance Watcher’ augments our understanding by delivering probabilistic insights into areas most likely affected by disturbances. While the damage probability index highlights changes to more forested regions, we have combined vegetation and entropy indices to this study to encompass both the vegetation impact and perhaps more human influenced land cover impacts. By integrating these data, we gain a more comprehensive view of Ian’s aftermath, combining direct observation with predictive analytics to determine areas of potential vulnerability and change.

    ## Damage on the Sanibel Causeway

    The devastating impact of Hurricane Ian resulted in the collapse of the Sanibel Causeway, a critical link connecting Sanibel Island to Florida's mainland. This destruction stranded numerous residents, necessitating boat-based evacuations and delivery of vital supplies, underscoring the hurricane's profound effects on offshore communities. The area around Punta Rassa, where the causeway commences, suffered extensive damage, further illustrating the severe consequences of Hurricane Ian on these coastal regions.

    ## Fort Myers Beach

    Heading to the main coast of Florida, high storm surge creates major inundation for Fort Myers Beach. Most of this area is developed, however, several miles inland are wetlands that experienced the major hit to vegetation from the water. Homes and businesses were mostly damaged or destroyed in this region.

    ## Sanibel Island

    Overall, the most significant change in vegetation as a result of Ian occurred on Sanibel Island. The highest winds and energy occurred in this area resulting in some of the highest storm surge and inundation from the other locations mentioned.
