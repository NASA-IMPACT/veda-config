    ## Overview    
    Hurricane Beryl was an extremely powerful hurricane that occurred in the Northern Atlantic Ocean in June and July of 2024. Beryl rapidly intensified to a Category 4 hurricane as it approached the Lesser Antilles, making landfall on Grenadaâ€™s Carriacou Island and causing significant damage. Once Beryl made its way into the Caribbean Sea, it reached Category 5 status - the highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The storm did not make any more landfalls until it weakened in the western Caribbean and struck Mexicoâ€™s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 2. It then moved into the Gulf of Mexico and made one final landfall near Matagorda, Texas as a Category 1 hurricane and moved over the Houston metro area before dissipating. 

    Beryl was the strongest hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean before July 4th since records began in 1851, with peak sustained winds estimated at 165 mph. Beryl was also the first Atlantic hurricane on record to reach Category 4 strength or higher during the month of June and just the second Category 5 hurricane to occur during the month of July. Beryl inflicted 71 direct fatalities and was responsible for over $8 Billion USD in damages.

    ## Satellite Analysis

    ##### Visible Satellite
    The evolution of Hurricane Beryl can be examined with great detail using visible satellite imagery datasets such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) platforms. All three of these satellite platforms have ties to NASA and their data are readily publicly available. GOES and MODIS visible data products have a spatial resolution of 0.5 to 1 km, while the VIIRS visible imagery has an even higher spatial resolution of 375 m, and all three platforms have at least daily temporal resolution. This quick return of high-resolution data allows for near-real-time analysis of the complexities of Hurricane Berylâ€™s structure as well as its track and intensity changes.

    ##### Infrared Satellite
    In addition to the visible data from GOES, MODIS, and VIIRS, all three of these platforms collect data in the infrared channels. This infrared data is crucial in not only examining the hurricane during the overnight hours due to visible data only being usable during the daytime, but also in analyzing the temperature of cloud tops in the storm. The temperature of the hurricaneâ€™s cloud tops can tell atmospheric scientists a great deal about whether the hurricane is experiencing strengthening or weakening and to what degree and speed that change in intensity may be occurring. Cloud top temperatures that quickly become colder in the eyewall region of the hurricane indicates that the storm may be rapidly intensifying, which would increase the risk to life and property should this occur as the storm is nearing a landfall. 

    ##### Surface Weather
    Several satellite remote sensing-based datasets can also be quite useful in providing near-surface meteorological data to atmospheric scientists in areas where surface observing stations may not be present, such as over a large body of water. The Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals (IMERG) product of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) provides both total precipitation accumulation and precipitation rate data at 30 minute intervals worldwide. IMERG data can be used by National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center meteorologists to help hone predictions of what flooding threat the hurricane may pose while it is still offshore. Additionally, the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) platform provides estimates of surface wind speeds over the worldâ€™s oceans, which can be crucial for determining the size and intensity of a hurricaneâ€™s wind field before it reaches land. CYGNSS can also help meteorologists distinguish how big of a threat storm surge may be along the coasts that a hurricane may be predicted to impact. 

    Further, NASAâ€™s Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) team provides a twice daily state of the art global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product. SSTs are essential to hurricane forecasters in determining where a hurricane may be able to form and sustain itself, or even where it may be susceptible to weakening or strengthening. SSTs of approximately 26 Â°C (~80 Â°F) are the typical expected threshold of the amount of energy a hurricane requires from the surface of the ocean to form and sustain itself, and in Hurricane Berylâ€™s case SSTs were well above that, pushing 30 Â°C (86 Â°F) along some portions of its long track.
