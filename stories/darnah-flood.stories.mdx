    ## Overview
    <mark>🚧 This Data Story presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! 🚧</mark>
    
    On Monday, September 11, 2023, the city of Darnah, Libya experienced the [deadliest flood disaster of the 21st century](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/environment/floods-in-libya-s-derna-worst-disaster-in-21st-century/2992617&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1709231595507737&usg=AOvVaw3MuRygRSSxtExzI_shVddG), and Africa’s deadliest flood ever recorded. A storm in the Mediterranean Sea dubbed ‘Medicane Daniel’ moved over northeastern Libya on the evening of the 10th, dumping prolific rain over the desert the morning of the 11th. A record 16” of rainfall was measured in 24 hours at the city of Al-Bayda, Libya (just west of Derna) from ‘Medicane’ Daniel. Two dams upstream of Darnah collapsed during the heavy rains leading to approximately [25% of the city being destroyed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-than-1000-bodies-recovered-libyan-city-after-floods-minister-2023-09-12/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1709231595509452&usg=AOvVaw083l0kMybsbbwT18u4SVTm). The first dam broke around 3:00 AM local time on September 11th, and the second followed suit shortly thereafter, which exacerbated the death toll greatly. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that proceeding the dam bursts, a wave as high as 23 feet (7 meters) rushed towards the city. With a population of 120,000, the major city of Darnah saw massive destruction, with entire districts of the city being washed away.Nearly 1,000 buildings are estimated to have been completely destroyed as well as 5 major bridges that connect the west and east sides of the city. The  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs initially reported a death toll currently sits at 11,300 with another 10,100 reported missing. This estimate was later revised to [3,958 fatalities](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/libya-floods-conflicting-death-tolls-greek-aid-workers-die-in-crash) on September 18.
