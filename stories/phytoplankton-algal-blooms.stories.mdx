    ## Phytoplankton: Beneficial or Harmful?
    
    Phytoplankton, microscopic plants that live in the ocean and inland waters, are responsible for most of the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean. Carbon dioxide is consumed during photosynthesis, and the carbon is incorporated in the phytoplankton, just as carbon is stored in the leaves of a tree on land. This is called primary productivity, and much like on land, in the ocean and inland waters it is fundamental to feeding other organisms and generating most of the oxygen we breathe.

    However, there are different types of phytoplankton, and some can be less beneficial for the ecosystem than others. Many people who live along the coast are familiar with harmful algal blooms (HAB), also known as red tides. These dangerous conditions occur when certain species of phytoplankton increase rapidly, resulting in damaging effects to other organisms. For example, they can suffocate marine life when they grow too fast. Some HAB-forming organisms produce toxins that affect sea life and humans, causing respiratory problems for those on land close to the water where they form.

    Global warming and environmental pollution have led to a rise in the number and severity of HAB outbreaks, which can occur in seawater and fresh water around the world. For example, Florida experiences HABs in its coastal waters and in inland lakes, such as Lake Okeechobee. HAB outbreaks are now even happening in the Arctic, because of warming ocean conditions. Scientists are discovering that some HAB species survive well under increased CO2 concentrations and warmer temperatures, which could indicate more HABs in the future.

    From the vantage point of space, satellites, including NASA's Aqua/MODIS sensor (image below) and the NASA and U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Landsat 8, can help scientists identify where a HAB has formed and better understand how and why they occur. It's a complicated data analysis process, but one that researchers are automating to assist resource managers in identifying potential problems.

    At the end of winter, the ice is nearly all gone from Lake Erie, and growing phytoplankton populations are revealed mingling with suspended sediments in this relatively shallow Great Lake.

    In Lake Erie in North America, satellite imagery sensors show how the area affected by blooms has increased. These increases in frequency have been related to human activity, such as agriculture practices, which may increase the amount of nutrients in natural waters, creating an imbalance that may favor HAB. Similarly, global warming may cause increases in water temperature that may create conditions that negatively affect non-HAB forming phytoplankton, but benefit HAB-forming species.

    It is important to be able to identify and predict blooms. Industries like tourism and fisheries, as well as local health officials can prepare better to mitigate the effect of a HAB. For example, oyster fisheries can close before oysters get contaminated. Municipalities can mobilize resources ahead of time to clean up beaches where a HAB is expected to cause large fish kills.

    Satellite data and models can be combined with water samples to identify and eventually predict HAB occurrences to help us understand why they happen and to mitigate or lessen the harmful effects. Ultimately, this is also important to better understand exchange of carbon and nutrients between the land, the atmosphere, and aquatic environments.
