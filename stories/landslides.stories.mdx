  ### Introduction

  Landslides are powerful and often sudden movements of rock, soil, and debris down a slope, driven primarily by gravity. While they can occur without warning, they’re often triggered by intense rainfall, rapid snowmelt, earthquakes, or human activity like deforestation and construction. In tropical and mountainous regions, the risk of landslides significantly increases during and after major storms—especially hurricanes—when saturated soils lose cohesion. Understanding where and when these events are likely to occur is critical for protecting vulnerable communities and infrastructure. With advanced Earth observation tools and platforms, we can now better visualize, analyze, and anticipate the conditions that lead to these hazardous events.

  ##### Case Study - Hurricane Helene

  A powerful example of how hurricanes can lead to dangerous landslides is 2024’s Hurricane Helene. While the storm caused major damage along the Florida coast, its most lasting impact happened farther inland. Helene formed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 23, 2024, and moved into the Gulf of America as a Category 1 hurricane. Over the next three days, it quickly strengthened into a Category 4 storm with winds reaching 140 miles per hour before making landfall near Perry, Florida. Although the coast faced strong winds and storm surge, the storm’s heaviest rainfall impacted the southern Appalachian Mountains region. The rainfall in this region was a combination of Hurricane Helene’s direct impact as well as from a Predecessor Rain Event (PRE), which is a heavy rainfall event that can occur ahead of a hurricane when moisture from the outer bands of a hurricane interacts with a stationary front. Over the period of four days, the heavy and consistent rainfall overwhelmed rivers and soaked steep hillsides in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, upstate South Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. In North Carolina alone, more than 2,000 landslides were reported. These slides damaged roads, isolated communities, and showed how a hurricane’s impact can continue long after it passes, especially when it moves over areas with complex terrain.
