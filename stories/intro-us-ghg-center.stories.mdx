    ## Why be Concerned about Greenhouse Gases?

    Agencies within the U.S. Federal Government and partners have programs and assets that observe and collect information on our changing planet, including emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs).

    Elevated concentrations of GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide, are warming the planet. This is leading to changes in Earth's climate that occur at a pace and in a way that threatens human health, society, and the natural environment. These changes include warmer air and ocean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, retreating snow and ice, increasingly severe weather events, such as hurricanes of greater intensity, and sea level rise, among other impacts.

    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states: "it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land" and that ["widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred."](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) The data shows trends and patterns in carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) from anthropogenic (human-related) and natural sources that can be used to inform decisions.

    Federal agencies are working together to develop a Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System (GHGMMIS) for the U.S. that combines atmospheric- and activity-based approaches to increase confidence in setting, assessing, and meeting climate mitigation goals. This system uses these advanced capabilities, as well as the growth of GHG observational data and models, to provide enhanced emissions and uptake data products.

    The US GHG Center will disseminate this GHG data as well as provide decision support tools, engage with users, develop data quality criteria, and communicate data, capability, and expertise needs.
    
    The US GHG Center team works to inform mitigation efforts for a range of stakeholders and forms an interface between Federal and non-Federal activities to improve quantification of greenhouse gas exchange within the Earth system.

    ## US GHG Center Portal Purpose

    The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) is a multi-agency effort to compile greenhouse gas data from observations and models into one environment containing trusted greenhouse gas emissions and flux products for use in research, decision-making, and other applications.

    The US GHG Center is built on open source principles and techniques that allow users to access, analyze, visualize, and apply data and products to their own usage.

    With this wealth of data pertaining to greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas emissions, and related ancillary information, the US GHG Center can be used to increase understanding of the types of GHG data and measurement platforms to facilitate wider and appropriate usage of GHG information.

    The US GHG Center is coordinated by NASA in partnership with EPA, NIST and NOAA. These agencies are collaborating to develop the Center with the goal of accelerating the production and delivery of GHG information, including a curated collection of GHG datasets, workflows and visualizations from the federal government and non-public sector.
    
    The Center acts as an enabler of collaboration with networks of interagency, international, intergovernmental and private sector partners to increase confidence in setting, assessing, and meeting climate mitigation goals. US GHG Center partner efforts accelerate the production and delivery of actionable, quality vetted GHG information, including a curated collection of datasets, workflows and visualizations from the federal government and non-public sector.   

    The US GHG Center is more than just a funnel for greenhouse gas datasets packaged into a user interface. The Center also reports on various efforts to engage stakeholders, increase understanding through webinars and training events, inform communities, and empower users with decision insights.

    ## Relationship to Other GHG Activities

    
    The Greenhouse Gas Monitoring & Measurement Interagency Working Group (IWG) was created in January 2022 to coordinate an approach that brings together Federal, subnational, commercial, philanthropic, and academic capabilities to accelerate the Nation’s progress towards an integrated GHG monitoring and information system that supports the Administration’s GHG reduction goals and mitigation efforts.  The IWG has  developed a National Strategy to Advance an Integrated [U.S. Greenhouse Measurement, Monitoring and Information System (U.S. GHGMMIS)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NationalGHGMMISStrategy-2023.pdf).
    
    The U.S. Government is using a phased approach to implement the National Strategy, with Phase 1 taking advantage of, and integrating, mature research capabilities and existing data, and Phase 2 reflecting a more robust monitoring and information system based on well-defined requirements as well as planning and research and development efforts from Phase 1. The US GHG Center supports both phases of the implementation of the National Strategy, following an iterative approach, which begins with input from EPA, NASA, NIST, and NOAA, and is expected to expand and include other agency and non-federal capabilities in the future.

    The US GHG Center plans to coordinate with networks of international organizations - including the World Meteorological Organization, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, and the UN Environment’s International Methane Emissions Observatory - to accelerate development and dissemination of the measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification of GHGs. It also will establish criteria for thorough evaluation of the quality, accessibility, and transparency of new data and modeling products.

    ## What Datasets are in the US GHG Center and Why These?

    The US GHG Center contains trusted information on greenhouse gas emissions, concentrations and flux products.

            <figcaption>Large Methane Emission Events</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    The initial 2-year demonstration phase of the project has targeted three GHG areas of study in order to:
        - Provide access to selected anthropogenic gas emission data products;
        - Complement anthropogenic GHG inventories with estimates of natural GHG emissions, updates and other fluxes of GHGs, as well as improved usability and visualizations;
        - Identify and quantify emissions from large methane leak events leveraging aircraft and space-borne instruments.

    The US GHG Center is not a comprehensive accounting of all GHG-relevant products and datasets produced by the U.S. Federal Government. Additional features and data sets will be added as more become available, with links throughout the site to additional resources beyond the Center.
