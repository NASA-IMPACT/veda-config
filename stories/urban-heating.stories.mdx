    ## Implications for Heat Stress

    Heat stress includes a series of conditions where the body undergoes stress due to overheating– typically from exposure to hot weather. It is a natural hazard that causes a large number of fatalities globally. Those at a greatest risk of heat stress include children, the elderly, and people with medical conditions, however, even young and healthy individuals can experience heat stress when exposed to intense heat or when conducting strenuous activities in hotter conditions. In the coming decades, climate change may cause more frequent heat waves, which could exacerbate heat-induced health issues. Future urban growth could also strengthen the urban heat island effect–in which infrastructure absorbs and re-emit the sun's heat at rates higher than natural landscapes–causing more severe heat events in urban populations.
    
    In urban areas a variety of individual, social, and geographic factors determine an individual's heat risk. Social structures and segregation in urban areas can increase the risk of unequal heat exposure. This discovery will be using NASA Earth observations to explore heat stress inequalities throughout areas of urban growth in Houston, Texas over the past 20 years.

    ### Using Satellite Data to Study Urban Heat

    Using satellite data and socioeconomic information, a complete picture of Houston’s urban growth can be examined to further understand the impacts of heat stress. To study how the city is changing over time, land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) was used. This data classifies land cover types in areas as small as 30m x 30m every 3 years. Greenspace–a dedicated space for vegetation in an urban space, such as a park–also plays a big role in urban heat. To measure vegetation, such as trees and grass, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) metric is used. On this scale, bare ground = 0 and dense vegetation = 1. This information comes from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Terra platform.
    
    To study urban heat and surface temperature (LST), data from Terra MODIS was used. LST does not measure air temperature, but instead measures the temperature of the pavement. Increases in LST are generally associated with increases in air temperature and heat stress.

    The aggregation of this Earth science information is useful for understanding the geography of heat. To see the direct impact of heat stress in urban environments on humans, we need information regarding urban populations.The Center for Disease Control (CDC) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the CDC’sSocial Vulnerability Index (SVI)  were used to provide such information.

    ### Utilizing Land Cover Maps
    Using land cover maps, the increase of urban and built-up land-cover was measured. It was found that the area of urban and built-up land cover increased by more than 20% in the last two decades. By comparing land cover maps from 2001 and 2019, a substantial increase in urban areas along the southwestern part of the city can be seen (Figure 1 - slide to compare years).  A similar comparison can be done with average temperature. Figure 2 shows Houston’s average temperature from 2000-2009 compared to 2010-2019. The maps show higher average temperatures over similar regions in the southwestern part of the city. These higher temperatures carry into the night, too, although they are less intense.
