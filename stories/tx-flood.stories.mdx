    ### Introduction 
    In the early hours of July 4, 2025, the Texas Hill Country experienced a catastrophic flash flood that would etch itself into the history books as the sixth deadliest freshwater flooding disaster in the United States. Over the course of just a few harrowing hours, intense rainfall transformed the Guadalupe River into a raging torrent that engulfed Kerr County, sweeping away cabins, homes, and vehicles from Camp Mystic to Ingram, Kerrville, and Center Point, before continuing downstream north and east of San Antonio. As of July 7, 2025, the death toll attributed to this catastrophe has surpassed the fatalities caused by freshwater flooding from Hurricane Helene. This disaster unfolded in an area already reeling from a prolonged drought that left soils hard-baked and unable to absorb water, priming the region for dangerous runoff. As rescue and recovery teams continue combing debris along the riverbanks, the event stands as a sobering reminder of the lethal intersection between extreme rainfall, vulnerable terrain, and the unique hydrology of America’s flash-flood capital.
