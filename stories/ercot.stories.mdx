    ## Overview
    Texas operates a largely independent power grid through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), serving approximately 90% of the state’s electric load. This isolation, combined with limited cold and heat weatherization, makes the ERCOT grid uniquely vulnerable to extreme weather events. In recent years, Texans have experienced firsthand how both deep freezes and miserable heat waves can stress this grid to its limits. With an increasing population, understanding these dual threats are essential for building a more resilient energy future for the state. ERCOT has been tested by historical extremes that have made national headlines, including the 2021 winter storm and summer heatwaves in 2022-2024. Despite plenty of exposure to this problem, implementing better mitigation practices remains a priority to sustain the grid.

    ## February 2021 Deep Freeze
    Between February 10 and 27, 2021, Texas experienced one of its most damaging weather events in recent history. Known as “The Great Texas Freeze,” a long-lasting winter storm brought freezing temperatures, snow, and ice that overwhelmed much of the state. All counties in Texas were placed under a Winter Storm Warning during the event — something rarely seen in a state better known for its extreme heat.

    At the peak of the storm, hourly data showed that about 4.5 million customers were without power at the same time. However, this does not reflect the full impact. When looking at the maximum number of customers without power in each county over the course of the event, a total of 5.2 million unique customers were affected across the state, according to EAGLE-I data. Out of 14.9 million tracked customers, that means more than one-third experienced an outage at some point. ERCOT later reported that the grid came within four minutes and 37 seconds of total failure — an outcome that could have left parts of the state in the dark for weeks.

   The human toll was devastating. The state reported 246 deaths, but other analyses suggest the real number may have been as high as 702 — nearly three times the death toll from Hurricane Harvey. One way to see the scale of the blackout is through satellite data. NASA’s Black Marble imagery of Houston shows a major drop in nighttime artificial light emissions between February 10 and 16, reflecting how widespread and long-lasting the outages were in both urban and rural areas.

    The freeze raised urgent questions about how energy systems in Texas are prepared for extreme cold. Natural gas pipelines, wind turbines, and power plants failed due to freezing conditions. Meanwhile, demand for energy soared. Natural gas prices across the U.S. spiked sharply in February 2021, reaching levels not seen in more than a decade.

   The 2021 storm showed how extreme cold can put serious stress on the electric grid. Equipment failures and fuel shortages during freezing conditions revealed gaps in how energy systems respond to winter weather. Preparing for future cold events will help reduce the risk of widespread outages and protect public safety when temperatures drop again.

    ## Recent Summer Heat Waves
    From 2022 through 2024, Texas faced a series of intense summer heatwaves, with record-breaking temperatures across much of the state. Unlike winter events, where energy supply can be interrupted by freezing conditions, the main challenge during summer is extremely high demand. As temperatures soared, millions of homes and businesses increased their use of air conditioning, placing heavy stress on the state’s power generation and transmission systems.

   On multiple days in 2023, ERCOT issued conservation alerts, asking Texans to reduce electricity use during peak afternoon hours to help prevent rolling blackouts. On June 23, 2023, MODIS satellite data recorded land surface temperatures exceeding 110°F across large portions of western Texas, highlighting the extreme conditions that drove energy use higher. That summer, ERCOT reported a record peak electricity demand of 85.51 gigawatts in August - the highest in state history at the time. Just one year later, that record was broken again, with demand reaching 85.56 gigawatts.

   This spike in electricity use also led to a sharp rise in natural gas consumption, as shown in the ERCOT natural gas usage data. The hourly time series reveals how demand steadily increased through the summer months, peaking alongside the hottest weeks of the year. These heatwaves tested the limits of the ERCOT grid, reinforcing the need to prepare for prolonged periods of high demand during extreme heat.

    ## Moving Forward: Building a Resilient Grid
    The future of energy in Texas hinges on preparing for both cold and hot extremes. After the 2021 Deep Freeze, ERCOT and state regulators implemented limited reforms, including mandatory winterization of some infrastructure and increased communication protocols. However, experts argue that more still needs to be done.

    Diversifying energy sources will be critical, especially by expanding battery storage, grid interconnectivity, and demand response systems. Enhanced real-time monitoring using satellite remote sensing and ground observations can also provide early warning for periods of peak stress. Further, integrating renewable energy like wind and solar with resilient backup systems can help balance supply and demand during volatile weather conditions. Without significant investment and modernization, the risk of future blackouts remains.

    ## Conclusion
    The events of recent years have highlighted the operational limits of the ERCOT grid under extreme weather conditions, continuing to direct the public’s attention to the importance of a reliable and flexible power infrastructure. Texas’ energy system must be equipped to handle peak demand, regardless of season, without risking large-scale blackouts or cascading failures. Advances in satellite remote sensing and ground observational monitoring, grid forecasting, and diversified energy strategies can support better decision-making and emergency response. By applying lessons from past disruptions and investing in resilient, forward-looking strategies, ERCOT can strengthen its ability to meet the future needs of Texas residents, industries, and communities.
