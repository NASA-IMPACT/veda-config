    **Disclaimer**: This study demonstrates innovative and practical applications of NASA Earth science data to highlight existing environmental inequities. Please note that the results have not undergone peer review.

    The Black Belt is a region in the Southern United States. The term "Black Belt" originally referred to the region's fertile black soil, ideal for agriculture, particularly cotton plantations. This soil resulted from the weathering of limestone bases in the Selma Chalk region.
