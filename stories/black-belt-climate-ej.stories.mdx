    The Black Belt is a region in the Southern United States OF America. The term "Black Belt" originally referred to the region's fertile black soil, ideal for agriculture, particularly cotton plantations. The fertile soil of the Black Belt is intricately connected to the weathering of limestone bases in the Selma Chalk region, which dates back to the Cretaceous Period when the Gulf of Mexico's shoreline was much further inland. Over millions of years, plankton deposited exoskeletons rich in calcium carbonate, leading to the formation of soft limestone known as Selma Chalk. This geological process resulted in a chalky subsoil that, due to its high calcium content, provides exceptional fertility, making the Black Belt particularly suitable for agriculture.

      During the 19th century, the Black Belt became synonymous with large-scale cotton production, heavily reliant on enslaved African American labor. After the Civil War, many freed African Americans continued to work in agriculture as sharecroppers or tenant farmers.
