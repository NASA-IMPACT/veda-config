            Methane is a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about one third of all warming resulting from human emissions. While there are some naturally-occurring emission sources, more than one-quarter of the methane in our atmosphere comes from the production, processing, transmission and use of natural gas and petroleum. Because methane traps more heat than carbon dioxide and it has a relatively shorter lifetime in our atmosphere, finding and limiting methane emissions is one of the best opportunities for reducing near term global warming. 

            New technologies in airborne and space-based instruments can detect and quantify large methane release events.

    ## Sources of Methane Emissions
    Relative to carbon dioxide, methane is estimated to be 86 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the 20 years after release (Myhre et al., 2013). Moreover, where carbon dioxide lingers for centuries, methane persists for about a decade, meaning that if emissions are reduced, the atmosphere will respond in a similar timeframe, leading to slower near-term warming.
    
    Methane is a flammable gas that is invisible to the human eye. Natural gas has a methane content of around 95% in the United States. Because it is used widely for heating and cooking there are distribution systems for natural gas throughout our cities and towns. While most methane emissions come from the waste sector (landfills, wastewater treatment), and agriculture (livestock and rice farming) methane is also released during coal mining and the production, transport, and processing of oil and natural gas.

    Methane emission prevention activities like leak detection and repair enables emission mitigation. Burning methane by flaring results in CO₂, which is also a greenhouse gas, but one that is a less potent contributor to climate change than methane. Increasingly, industries such as landfills and wastewater management capture the methane that is produced and burn it either for electricity generation or to prevent it from entering the atmosphere. This can also reduce toxic gases like benzene that often occur with methane.

        Large methane emissions represent a significant proportion of total methane emissions across the oil & gas, waste, manure management, and coal sectors (Cusworth et al., 2022). Identifying the source of methane emissions improves our understanding of greenhouse gas budgets, can inform future inventories, offers the potential to inform mitigation strategies, and in some cases has resulted in emission mitigation.

        Today we have new remote measurement technologies to map these methane emissions from space and aircraft.

            ## Detecting Methane Emissions at the Source

            Satellite and aircraft remote measurements can now locate and characterize methane point source emissions. At the scale of an individual oil field or landfill, these methods can observe methane plumes at specific locations. These are often associated with visible infrastructure (well pads, tanks, compressor stations) or even buried gathering lines. These plumes reflect a mixture of expected and unintended emissions (leaks).

            Below is an example of an intermittent methane plume observed from space with NASA's Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation <a href="https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit" style={{ color: '#1565EF' }} target="_blank">EMIT</a> imaging spectrometer aboard the International Space Station. This example shows the Permian Basin, which is the largest petroleum-producing basin in the United States. The plume was observed on Feb. 5, 2023 but in subsequent observations methane plumes were not visible at this location.

            When organic material is thrown away and buried in landfills it begins to decompose. If this material decomposes in conditions with limited oxygen, considerable methane can be produced, enough that the methane emissions that if not captured or flared can be detected from space. Waste sector emissions represent around 18% of global human related methane emissions (Saunois et al., 2020). The EMIT example below from Apr. 23, 2023 shows a prominent methane plume from a landfill outside of Phoenix, Arizona.

            Methane leaks in populated areas can be a danger to public safety. Detecting plumes at the detail of high spatial resolution can help locate specific emission sources. This serves as actionable information to utilities so that they can fix leaks. The example provided below shows methane plumes observed using the <a target="_blank" href="https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/" style={{ color: '#1565EF' }}>Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG)</a> as part of the California Methane Survey (Duren et al., 2019). Multiple flights on the same day observed methane in this residential location. The gas utility used these methane plume images to verify and repair the leak from a natural gas distribution line in a residential neighborhood.

            A 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2 included guidance on calculating emissions from “anomalous leak events” for national GHG Inventories. The 2019 IPCC Refinement provides examples of anomalous events, including emergency pressure relieving equipment and well blowouts, and specifies that these events should be evaluated and estimated on a case-by-case basis using the best available data.  

            The U.S. GHG Inventory currently incorporates estimates for four anomalous leak events from natural gas systems, including one storage well blowout event and three production blowout events. The estimates were taken from research studies and other resources that quantified emissions from the events using satellite observations along with other data. This demo area aims to quantify additional anomalous leak events for incorporation into the GHG Inventory.

            ## How Methane Mapping Works

            Remote measurement technologies can now map methane plumes by measuring the methane spectral fingerprint in reflected solar energy beyond wavelengths the human eye can see. Methane absorbs energy uniquely in specific wavelengths. By measuring these wavelengths we can map where the methane occurs based on its spectral fingerprint. The strength of the absorption can tell us how much methane is in the atmosphere below the instrument.

            Advanced airborne and satellite imaging spectrometers measure solar energy that passes through the Earth’s atmosphere and is reflected off of Earth’s surface at hundreds of different wavelengths. These instruments have an array of detectors so that they can capture images of the Earth. The methane spectral fingerprint for EMIT is shown in the figure below. In addition to permit mapping of methane plume strengths, these spectral fingerprints also enable estimates of methane amounts and rate of release into the atmosphere.

        ## The Expanding Future of Tracking Methane Emissions
        These results from EMIT and AVIRIS-NG are offered as examples. There are other aircraft and satellite missions that have detected large emissions plumes, such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa), and HISUI (Hyperspectral Imager Suite), which is on the International Space Station. A number of new missions are planned in the near term (Jacob et al., 2022), and the additional measurements of this expanding constellation will allow us to gain a comprehensive picture of large methane emissions in the United States and around the world. Identifying large methane emissions also offers the potential for emission mitigation of this potent greenhouse gas. 

        Airborne instruments will remain important as they can observe smaller emissions that can not be observed with satellites. The JPL Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) program generates publicly available, airborne data that has been used for mapping methane across the western hemisphere. Methane observations from this platform provide high resolution observations over targeted areas, and will be incorporated into the US GHG Center’s available data and used to support calibration and validation of EMIT measurements. 

        The US GHG Center will continue to demonstrate the utility of airborne and satellite data to characterize large emission events. Also the US GHG Center will quantify emissions from identified large leak events for incorporation into the GHGI.  Interagency coordination of calibration, validation, and data standards will improve the quality and availability of emission source data from EMIT, AVIRIS-3, and other platforms.
