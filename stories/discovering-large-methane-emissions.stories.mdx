            Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. While there are some naturally-occurring emission sources, most methane in our atmosphere comes from the production, processing, transmission and use of natural gas and petroleum. When released into the Earth’s atmosphere, methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide contributing to climate change. Because methane traps more heat than carbon dioxide and it has a shorter ‘lifespan’ in our atmosphere, finding and limiting methane emissions is an ideal target for short-term action on slowing climate change. 
            
            New technologies can now detect and quantify large methane release events. This information from airborne and space instruments can help decision makers to reduce the contribution of methane to climate change and inform future greenhouse gas inventories.

    ## Introduction
    Relative to carbon dioxide, methane is estimated to be 86 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the 20 years after release (Myhre et al., 2013). Moreover, where carbon dioxide lingers for centuries, methane persists for about a decade, meaning that if emissions are reduced, the atmosphere will respond in a similar timeframe, leading to slower near-term warming.
    
    Methane is a flammable gas that is invisible to the human eye. Natural gas has a methane content of around 95%. Because it is used widely for heating and cooking there are distribution systems for natural gas throughout our cities and towns. Methane emissions can occur during the production, transport, and processing of oil and natural gas. Methane is also released from coal mining, the waste sector (landfills, wastewater treatment), and agriculture (livestock and rice farming).

    Methane emission prevention activities like leak detection and repair enables emission mitigation. Burning methane by flaring results in CO2, which is also a greenhouse gas, but one that is a less potent contributor to climate change than methane. Increasingly, industries such as landfills and wastewater management capture the methane that is produced and burn it either for electricity generation or to prevent it from entering the atmosphere. This can also reduce toxic gases like benzene that often occur with methane.

        Large methane emissions represent a significant proportion of total methane emissions across the oil & gas, waste, manure, and coal sectors (Cusworth et al., 2022). Identifying methane point source emissions improves our understanding of greenhouse gas budgets, can inform future inventories, offers the potential to inform mitigation strategies, and has resulted in emission mitigation. 

        Today we have new remote measurement technologies to map these methane emissions from space and aircraft.

            ## Methane point source examples

            Satellite and aircraft remote measurements can now locate and characterize methane point source emissions. At the scale of an individual oil field, these methods can observe methane plumes at specific locations. These are often associated with visible infrastructure (well pads, tanks, compressor stations) or even buried gathering lines. These plumes reflect a mixture of expected and unintended emissions (leaks).

            Below is an example of an intermittent methane plume observed from space with NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation <a href="https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #0000FF;">EMIT ↗</a> in the Permian Basin, which is the largest petroleum-producing basin in the United States. The plume was observed on Feb. 5, 2023 but in subsequent observations methane plumes were not visible at this location.

            When organic material is thrown away and buried in landfills it begins to decompose. If this material decomposes in conditions with limited oxygen, considerable methane can be produced, enough that the methane emissions can be seen from space. Waste sector emissions represent around 18% of global human related methane emissions (Saunois et al., 2020). The EMIT example below from Apr. 23, 2023 shows a prominent methane plume from a landfill outside of Phoenix, Arizona.

            Methane leaks in populated areas can be a danger to public safety. Detecting plumes at the detail of high spatial resolution can help locate specific emission sources. This information  provides actionable information to utilities so that they can fix leaks. The example provided below shows methane plumes observed using the [Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG)](https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/) as part of the California Methane Survey (Duren et al., 2019). Multiple flights on the same day observed methane in this residential location. The gas utility used these methane plume images to verify and repair the leak from a natural gas distribution pipeline in a residential neighborhood.

            ## How Does Methane Mapping Work?

            Remote measurement technologies can map methane plumes by measuring the methane spectral fingerprint in reflected solar energy beyond wavelengths the human eye can see. Methane absorbs energy uniquely in specific wavelengths. By measuring these wavelengths with advanced instruments we can map methane based on its spectral fingerprint. The strength of the absorption can tell us how much methane is in the atmosphere below the instrument.

            Advanced airborne and satellite imaging spectrometers measure solar energy that passes through the Earth’s atmosphere and is reflected off of Earth’s surface at hundreds of different wavelengths. These instruments have an array of detectors so that they can capture images of the Earth. The methane spectral fingerprint for EMIT is shown in the figure below. In addition to permit mapping of methane plume strengths, these spectral fingerprints also enable estimates of methane amounts and rate of release into the atmosphere.

            [EMIT](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit) was launched on 14 July 2022 and is currently operating on the International Space Station (ISS). It provides wide coverage ~80 km swath at ~60 m spatial resolution with typical daily coverage equivalent to the area of Texas. EMIT is a NASA mission with all data and algorithms publicly available as part of NASA’s commitment to open data science.  This allows anyone to test the data, algorithms, and results and work for improvements.

        ## The Expanding Future of Methane Point Source Mapping
        These results from EMIT and AVIRIS-NG are offered as examples. There are other aircraft and satellite missions that have detected large emissions plumes, such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa), and HISUI (Hyperspectral Imager Suite), which is on the International Space Station. A number of new missions are planned in the near term (Jacob et al., 2022), and the additional measurements of this expanding constellation will allow us to gain a comprehensive picture of large methane emissions in the United States and around the world. It will also provide information to policy and decision makers. Identifying large methane emissions also offers the potential for emission mitigation of this potent greenhouse gas. 

        Airborne instruments will remain important as they can observe smaller emissions that can not be observed with satellites. The JPL Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) program generates publicly available, airborne data that has been used for mapping methane across the western hemisphere. Methane observations from this platform provide high resolution observations over targeted areas, and will be incorporated into the US GHG Center’s available data and used to support calibration and validation of EMIT measurements. 

        We will continue to demonstrate the utility of airborne and satellite data to characterize large emission events. Also work with the EPA continues to develop protocols for sharing this information and to inform future inventories. Interagency coordination of calibration, validation, and data standards will improve the quality and availability of point source data from EMIT, AVIRIS-3, and other platforms.
