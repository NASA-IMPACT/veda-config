    This image of a polar bear standing on floating sea ice tells just a portion
    of the story about the critical role of sea ice in the global ecosystem.
    Changes in sea ice thickness and coverage impact the habitat for polar bears
    and other wildlife. Sea ice changes also provide crucial information for
    scientists, as they observe and measure climate change. Data collected by
    satellites provide a long-ranging history of data to help researchers track
    the ice's height and rate of decline. Researchers continue to study the
    Arctic to learn more about the local and global consequences of diminishing
    sea ice.

    ## ICESat-2 and ATLAS

    Collecting repeated height measurements of the Earth's ice from space is an important way to view changes happening over the course of seasons and years. NASA provides data collected over the Arctic Ocean by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) that show monthly sea ice freeboard from 2018 to the present. Sea ice freeboard is the amount of sea ice and snow cover visible above the surface of the ocean and, along with snow depth, is a critical measurement for accurately measuring the thickness of sea ice in the polar oceans. While ICESat-2 can only measure the height of Earth's ice, scientists utilize special formulas (based on Archimedes' principle) to take those height measurements and turn them into measurements of sea ice freeboard that includes the ice above and below the waterline. More about this research can be found at the [ICESat-2 website](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/science).

    NASA's ICESat-2 mission has been measuring the height of the Earth's features from space with a laser ever since its launch in September 2018. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard ICESat-2 shoots pulses of light towards the Earth's surface. ATLAS counts the particles of light (i.e., photons) that bounce off the Earth's surface and return to the instrument's sensors, measuring the round-trip time of each photon with extreme accuracy. Scientists can then take the total elapsed time to generate a height measurement of the particular surface from which a photon bounced. When enough photon measurements have been collected, scientists group these measurements together to form a “photon cloud” that produces continuous surface elevation measurements as the satellite collects more and more data along its orbit. ICESat-2 collects data over the same location every 91 days, and this allows scientists to develop a picture of how the heights at certain spots around the globe are changing over time.

    ### CryoSat-2 and Envisat

    While measurements from ICESat-2 can be used to determine the height and freeboard of polar sea ice, scientists need help from the Earth Observation Satellites ( ESA) and the CryoSat-2 mission to measure sea ice thickness. Researchers at ESA provide monthly measurements of sea ice thickness from the CryoSat-2 and Envisat radar altimeters. Click below to learn more about how ESA measures sea ice thickness from space.

    ESA has been building radar altimeters since the early 1990s. Radar altimeters use a microwave signal to measure sea ice freeboard. In this frequency band, the signal can penetrate further into the snow that often lies on top of sea ice. To better understand how far the radar signals can penetrate the snowpack, separate field or airborne campaigns are used to validate the satellite signals. Ongoing research is comparing altimeter signals at different frequencies to calculate how much snow lies on top of the sea ice. This is important as the amount of snow can also impact the freeboard—for instance a heavy snow-load can weigh the sea ice down and may even push it under water.

    Once the freeboard has been established, it can be converted to sea ice thickness. The ESA Climate Change Initiative Sea Ice Thickness data set (see data sets section) shows the decrease in winter sea ice thickness over the past 15 years using satellite information from ESA's Envisat and CryoSat-2 missions.
