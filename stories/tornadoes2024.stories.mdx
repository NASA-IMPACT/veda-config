    ### Overview

    The Spring 2024 tornado season was one of the most active on record in the United States. As of May 31st, there have been 1,176 tornadoes confirmed in the United States. The vast majority of these occurred in the meteorological spring months of March-May (Table 1), placing this period within the 90th percentile of activity compared to climatological averages. This three-month period was responsible for 36 fatalities, hundreds of injuries, and was the second most prolific tornado season since at least 1950â€“second only to the deadly 2011 tornado season. Through the end of May, severe thunderstorms alone accounted for nearly $42 billion in damage across the United States, with four tornado outbreaks during the spring attributing over $1 billion in damage each. Four tornadoes were rated violent EF-4s with wind speeds from 166-200 mph, and 27 were rated as intense EF-3s with wind speeds from 136-165 mph.

  The National Weather Service (NWS) issued numerous tornado warnings during the Spring 2024 tornado season. A total of 1,728 tornado warnings were issued across the United States from March to May, with several of these being upgraded to Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Warnings if the tornado was confirmed to be large and actively damaging structures. An even smaller subset were further upgraded to Tornado Emergencies if the tornado was confirmed to be large and was directly threatening a larger population center. As a result, millions of Americans were impacted by tornado warnings during the Spring of 2024, with the vast majority of counties in the country's midsection seeing a warning at least once during the three-month period. Compared to average spring severe weather seasons, the Southeast United States saw a less active season, while the Great Plains and Midwest saw a more active season.

Intense tornadoes are defined as those that receive an EF-3 rating or higher. From March through May of 2024, there were a total of 31 intense tornadoes (Table 2). About half of these intense tornadoes inflicted fatalities, and the majority of them caused injuries. The combined damage paths of these tornadoes exceeded an astounding 630 miles throughout several locations in Americaâ€™s midsection.

    ### Datasets Utilized
    The far-reaching impacts of the Spring 2024 tornado season can be seen in analyzing several dataset types, from satellite remote sensing to ground-based observations and even post-storm damage survey data.
  </Prose>
</Block>

<Block type='wide'>
  <Prose>
    
    **PlanetScope**  
    Initial overview of Planet (TRENT)

    Planet imagery was also utilized to examine the difference in reflectance values of the visible bands before and after a tornado strike. This analysis reveals where the most intense damage may have occurred, and can even be related back to building-level damage due to the high spatial resolution of Planet data. A simple linear regression statistical analysis was performed on Planet imagery of the May 21st Greenfield, Iowa EF-4 damage. This showed that the difference in the Planet imageryâ€™s green channel coupled with the NWS degree of damage assigned to each building during their post-storm damage survey can be used to predict the EF rating of the building over 70% of the time.

    
    **Night Lights**  
    Going to look into using this for May 8 in HSV area - if not, remove from this list


    **WSR-88D and Doppler On Wheels**  
    The Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR-88D) is a network of radars used by the NWS to monitor weather patterns, including tornadoes, across large areas. In addition, the Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radar, which is mounted on vehicles and can get closer to storms, was examined in cases where it was deployed in order to gather more detailed information. DOW radars are typically used for research and can capture clearer, higher-resolution data on tornadoes, while WSR-88D provides a wider view but with slightly less detail.

    
    **NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit**  
    The NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT) is a geographic information system (GIS)-hosted dataset where post-storm damage survey results are uploaded and referenced to the location where each description of damage occurred. This dataset includes center lines of all tornado tracks, polygons that break down the EF rating at each point along the path, descriptions of the damage at each entry point, and ground damage pictures of the damage at most entry points.

    ### March 14

    On Thursday, March 14th, 2024, several devastating tornadoes carved paths of destruction across eastern Indiana and Western and Central Ohio. Two of these were rated as intense EF-3s on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and were responsible for all of the fatalities seen from this severe weather outbreak. Two primary supercell thunderstorms formed in central Indiana and moved eastward. The first, located further north, produced five tornadoes during its more than 120-mile path from Adams County, Indiana to Licking County, Ohio during the afternoon to early evening hours. The second storm, situated further south, produced two tornadoes later in the evening along its more than 75-mile path from Delaware County, Indiana to Miami County, Ohio. There were also two other cyclic thunderstorms that produced a combined three tornadoes in northern Ohio from this event. Overall, this regional tornado outbreak is responsible for 11 tornadoes across Indiana and Ohio, causing 4 fatalities and 68 injuries.

    ### April 26

    After a relatively calm period through much of April, the tornado outbreak on April 26th triggered an extremely active phase of severe weather across the United States. On the day before the tornado outbreak, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Level 3/5 Enhanced Risk of severe weather, including tornadoes, over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa southward into the Kansas City metropolitan area. The Center maintained this risk delineation into the day of the outbreak. Several significant tornadoes occurred from a broken line of supercell thunderstorms within this Enhanced Risk zone in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, with the strongest being EF-4 in intensity. A rare tornado emergency was issued for West Elkhorn, Nebraska for this EF-4 tornado. In the Omaha, Nebraska NWS County Warning Area, this tornado outbreak was responsible for the second largest daily tornado count since at least 1950, and produced the strongest tornadoes for the region since 2014. Overall, there were 76 confirmed tornadoes in CONUS on April 26th, resulting in 1 fatality and 16 injuries.

    ##### Lincoln, NE EF-3
    The first intense tornado of the day struck near 84th Street in Lincoln, Nebraska, carving an 8.6-mile path through Lancaster County with winds up to 158 mph. Touching down around 2:52 PM and lifting at 3:04 PM, the tornado caused significant damage but no fatalities, though three people were injured. Shortly after forming, it hit a business and large transmission line, then moved northeast, severely damaging a manufacturing plant, where the roof and three walls collapsed, and cars were thrown up to 100 yards. It continued by derailing a train, snapping tree trunks, and scattering debris before weakening near 141st Street.

    ##### West Elkhorn, NE EF-4
    Shortly after the Lincoln EF-3 tornado lifted, a more violent tornado struck the northwestern Omaha suburbs, moving through Douglas and Washington Counties in Nebraska and into Harrison County in Iowa. On the ground for over 31 miles with winds up to 170 mph, the tornado caused extensive damage but no fatalities, though the number of injuries is unknown. It began near West Q Road, quickly intensifying as it crossed highways, damaging homes, and overturning farm equipment. After crossing the Elkhorn River, it leveled four houses in western Elkhorn and expanded to one mile in width near Highway 31, snapping power poles and trees. The tornado then moved through residential areas, causing damage in Bennington and inflicting severe damage to rural homes in Washington County before weakening and lifting near Modale, Iowa.

    ##### Minden-Harlan, IA EF-3
    The final intense tornado of the day, likely stronger than its official rating, hit Pottawattamie and Shelby Counties in Iowa, covering 40.9 miles with peak winds of 160 mph. Beginning at 5:25 PM and lifting at 6:29 PM, it caused one fatality and three injuries. Starting east of McClelland, the tornado intensified near Sycamore Road and grew to 800 yards wide as it approached Minden, causing severe EF-3 damage to homes and buildings. Multiple vortices were observed in Minden, where it caused the most destruction and led to fatalities and injuries. Northeast of Minden, it widened to nearly a mile, flipping a semi-truck on Interstate 80 and damaging homes, trees, and vehicles along the way. Near Harlan, Doppler radar detected wind speeds up to 224 mph just above the ground, suggesting potential for EF-5 damage. The tornado weakened near Defiance, eventually dissipating at the Crawford-Shelby county line, with radar indicating it may have continued briefly into Crawford County.

    ### May 6-8

    Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms occurred across much of the eastern two thirds of CONUS from May 6-8th, 2024, with significant tornadoes occurring in several states. On May 6th, a rare High Risk (Level 5/5) for severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes, was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for much of Oklahoma. Thankfully, many of the storms did not produce the expected numerous intense tornadoes, but one storm to the northwest of Tulsa was able to tap into the volatile environment and spawn a violent and deadly EF-4 tornado. On May 7th, the more favorable conditions for tornadic storms moved into portions of the Lower Great Lakes, with the highest threat centered from Eastern Indiana and Southern Lower Michigan into Western Ohio. Several tornadoes occurred in these areas, with some classified as significant EF-2+ tornadoes. On May 8th, the threat shifted to the south, and the southern Middle Tennessee and northern Alabama area experienced a regional tornado outbreak from the mid-afternoon into the evening hours.

    ##### May 6: Barnsdall, OK EF-4
    The only notable tornado on May 6th was a violent EF-4 that impacted the town of Barnsdall, Oklahoma. It began southeast of Hominy, snapping trees before strengthening as it moved toward Barnsdall. Between Hominy and Barnsdall, the tornado intensified to EF-3, snapping  trees and destroying metal power poles. Southwest of Barnsdall, it reached EF-4 strength, destroying a well-built home. In Barnsdall, the tornado caused severe damage to homes and the wax plant on the townâ€™s east side, with winds estimated at 150-175 mph. As it moved northeast, the storm continued damaging trees, homes, and outbuildings. By the time it reached Bartlesville, the tornado weakened to EF-2, though it still damaged homes, businesses, and trees. The storm eventually dissipated northeast of Bartlesville. The tornado traveled around 40 miles, causing two fatalities and injuring 33 people.

    ##### May 7: Michigan and Ohio Significant Tornadoes
    In southwest Lower Michigan, several intense storms impacted areas south of Kalamazoo during the mid-afternoon of May 7th, prompting the first Tornado Emergency issuance in Michigan history as a high-end EF-2 tornado passed near Sherwood. The storm system produced two EF-2s, two EF-1s, and a brief EF-UNK just inside the northern Indiana border. The first EF-2 touched down near Centreville, causing extensive tree and property damage and destroying parts of several homes north of Sherwood. Video confirmed it as a multiple-vortex tornado at its peak, which is a tornado with smaller circulations orbiting the main funnel, which can intensify local damage along the tornado's path. The second EF-2 tornado struck Portage, traveling 11 miles through the city. It damaged homes, businesses, mobile home parks, and apartment complexes, uprooting hundreds of trees and causing a section of an industrial warehouse roof to collapse. Sixteen people were injured, making it Michigan's strongest tornado since the Gaylord EF-3 in 2022.

In central and eastern Indiana, the storms on May 7th had difficulty producing tornadoes initially, but as they moved into Ohio, several tornadoes developed. The strongest ones were in west-central and far eastern Ohio, where three EF-2 and several high-end EF-1 tornadoes touched down. One storm led to a particularly dangerous tornado warning for the Oxford, Ohio area. In total, 29 tornadoes were recorded across the region from southeastern Indiana to western Pennsylvania.

The first significant tornado of the day, an EF-2, formed west of Coldwater, Ohio. This large, wedge-shaped tornado caused major tree damage along the Wabash River and destroyed barns and outbuildings in Mercer County before it weakened and lifted near Coldwater. Shortly after, another EF-2 tornado touched down north of Chickasaw, damaging fields, tearing up two farm properties, and causing roof and wall damage. In another area, a high-end EF-1 tornado moved into Greenville, causing minor damage to homes and trees, with stronger winds destroying trees in the city park and damaging the high schoolâ€™s football stadium before weakening and lifting north of Gettysburg.

    ##### May 8: Tennessee Valley Regional Tornado Outbreak
    May 8 was the most prolific tornado producer of the storm systemâ€™s three-day period of activity, where a regional tornado outbreak affected south-central Tennessee and northern Alabama. One of the strongest tornadoes of the day, an EF-3, struck Columbia, TN, damaging homes along its 12.5-mile path through Maury and Marshall counties. With peak winds of 140 mph and a width of 900 yards, it destroyed multiple homes, caused one fatality, and injured 12 people before lifting near Lively, TN.

    In northern Alabama, the Huntsville area experienced its third-largest recorded tornado outbreak, with 20 tornadoes, including two EF-3s and one EF-2. The event unfolded in two waves: the first, from supercell storms around 8 PM until midnight, and the second, from a line of storms between 3 and 5:15 AM on May 9. Notable tornadoes included the Melton Bluff EF-3, which damaged homes along its 3.8-mile path, the Huntsville/Monte Sano EF-2, which struck highly populated areas, and the Henegar EF-3, which caused seven injuriesâ€”the highest for the event. Despite the widespread destruction, northern Alabama reported no fatalities, though eight people were injured across the state.

    ### May 21

    May 19-21st was an incredibly active stretch of severe weather in the central portion of the country, with May 21st being the worst tornadic day. The SPC issued a Moderate risk for severe weather across Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois on this day, with a 15% risk for significant tornadoes. An organized cluster of thunderstorms moved into western Iowa from Nebraska in the morning, bringing severe wind gusts, while additional storms developed along the Kansas-Nebraska border. A rare Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch was issued at midday for the majority of Iowa in anticipation of possible significant tornadoes in the state. By mid-afternoon, several supercells in southwestern Iowa moved northeast towards the Des Moines area. Multiple tornadoes were reported, including a violent and well-documented tornado near Corning and Greenfield, Iowa, where several fatalities and injuries occurred.

##### Greenfield, IA EF-4

The strongest tornado of the day, which was a violent EF-4 tornado and the strongest of the year, tore through Page, Taylor, Adams, and Adair counties in Iowa during the mid-afternoon. The tornado first touched down near Villisca in Page County, causing EF-1 damage before clipping Taylor County and entering Adams County, where it inflicted EF-0 and EF-1 damage to trees and a grain bin. North of Corning, the tornado reached EF-2 strength, destroying an outbuilding and part of a home, with a car being tossed on Iowa 148, resulting in one fatality. The storm intensified to high-end EF-3 near 150th Street in Adams County, where it leveled a cinder block home and toppled wind turbines, all while being captured by storm chasers documenting its intense, multiple vortex structure.

As the tornado moved into Adair County, it strengthened to low-end EF-4, leveling homes and outbuildings before turning toward Greenfield, where it inflicted mid-range EF-4 damage. In Greenfield, dozens of homes and mobile homes were destroyed, resulting in four additional fatalities and 35 injuries. A Doppler on Wheels vehicle recorded winds possibly reaching 290 mph near the ground in the eastern part of the city. After devastating Greenfield, the tornado rapidly weakened and lifted just east of the municipal airport, leaving behind a 44-mile path of destruction, five fatalities, and 35 injured.

    ### A Spring of Records

    The Spring 2024 tornado season broke several local, regional, and national records in the meteorology community, further cementing its place in U.S. severe weather history. The state of Ohio tied its previous annual record of 62 tornadoes by early June and has since well surpassed it by the time of this publication. Further, the state of Oklahoma experienced the most April tornadoes ever recorded, with 55 tornadoes confirmed. Several event-specific records were broken as well. The Charleston, West Virginia NWS County Warning Area set a new record for tornadoes in a single event on April 2nd, Arkansas witnessed a state record for tornado width on May 25th, the Omaha  NWS County Warning Area  saw the most tornado warnings ever issued in a single day on April 26th, and the Huntsville, Alabama  NWS County Warning Area  saw its third most tornadoes in a day in their coverage area on May 7th. Overall, the March-May period saw the second-highest tornado count in the United States since 1950, with only the historic 2011 season surpassing it. This historic season will be remembered not only for its destructive tornadoes but also for its unprecedented numbers, significantly impacting both communities and weather forecasting records across the United States.
