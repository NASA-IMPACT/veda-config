    ### Overview

    The Spring 2024 tornado season was one of the most active on record in the United States. As of May 31st, there have been 938 tornadoes confirmed in the United States. The vast majority of these occurred in the meteorological spring months of March-May (49 in March, 327 in April, and 473 in May), placing this period within the 90th percentile of activity compared to climatological averages. This three-month period was responsible for 36 fatalities, hundreds of injuries, and was the second most prolific tornado season since at least 1950â€“second only to the deadly 2011 tornado season. Three tornadoes were rated violent EF-4s with wind speeds from 166-200 mph, and 28 were rated as intense EF-3s with wind speeds from 136-165 mph.

    ### March 14

    On Thursday, March 14th, 2024, several devastating tornadoes carved paths of destruction across eastern Indiana and Western and Central Ohio. Two of these were rated as intense EF-3s on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and were responsible for all of the fatalities seen from this severe weather outbreak. Two primary supercell thunderstorms formed in central Indiana and moved eastward. The first, located further north, produced five tornadoes during its path from Adams County, Indiana to Licking County, Ohio during the afternoon to early evening hours. The second storm, situated further south, produced two tornadoes later in the evening from Delaware County, Indiana to Miami County, Ohio. There were also two other cyclic thunderstorms that produced a combined three tornadoes in northern Ohio from this event. Overall, this regional tornado outbreak is responsible for 11 tornadoes across Indiana and Ohio, causing 4 fatalities and 68 injuries.

    ### April 2

    The rest of March was relatively quiet, but tornado activity ramped up once again in the beginning of April. Though this event was originally expected to be a tornado outbreak across much of Indiana and Ohio, the warm front responsible for bringing a favorable tornadic environment to the north stalled its progression around the Ohio River. This boundary guided a long-lived Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) through much of the Ohio Valley, and within this MCS contained numerous short-lived tornadoes. The Evansville, IN area experienced significant impact, with four EF-2 tornadoes and several weaker tornadoes occurring to the west, north, and east of the city. The northern suburbs of Louisville, KY were also struck by two EF-2 tornadoes. The outbreak continued into southeastern Ohio and central West Virginia, where 17 tornadoes were confirmed in the Charleston, West Virginia County Warning Area (CWA), four of which were rated EF-2. This was a record for the most tornadoes ever confirmed from a single event for the CWA, with the previous record being 6 from the SuperOutbreak of 1974. Post-storm analysis confirmed the MCS met the necessary criteria for classification as a derecho, with a 92 mph wind gust at the Huntington, WV Tri-State airport being the highest wind speeds measured from this event.

    ### April 26

    After a relatively calm period through much of April, the tornado outbreak on April 26th triggered an extremely active phase of severe weather across the United States. On the day before the tornado outbreak, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Level 3/5 Enhanced Risk of severe weather, including tornadoes, over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa southward into the Kansas City metropolitan area. The Center maintained this risk delineation into the day of the outbreak. Several strong tornadoes occurred from a broken line of supercell thunderstorms within this Enhanced Risk zone in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, with the strongest being high-end EF-3 in intensity. A rare tornado emergency was issued for West Elkhorn, Nebraska for one of the high-end EF-3 tornadoes. In the Omaha, Nebraska CWA, this tornado outbreak was responsible for the second largest daily tornado count since at least 1950, and produced the strongest tornadoes for the region since 2014. Overall, there were 76 confirmed tornadoes in CONUS on April 26th, resulting in 1 fatality and 16 injuries.

    ### April 27

    The destruction occurring within the Great Plains continued on April 27th, as another significant tornado outbreak occurred over much of Oklahoma during the evening and overnight hours, spawning the first violent (EF-4+) tornado of the year in the United States. This outbreak was responsible for the first violent tornado in Oklahoma since the May 9, 2016 Katie, OK EF-4. Its severity pushed the state to a new record tornado count in the month of April. Within the NWS Norman, OK CWA, 32 tornadoes were confirmed, with six of them being significant EF-2+ tornadoes. Overall, this tornado outbreak spawned 51 tornadoes and inflicted 4 fatalities and 30 injuries.

    ### April 30

    A scattered severe weather outbreak occurred across the Great Plains on April 30th, with impressive tornadoes remaining in largely rural areas from Iowa to Texas. The NWS confirmed 11 tornadoes from this event, with the strongest official tornado rating being an EF-3 in Westmoreland, Kansas. However, an impressive supercell thunderstorm in southwest Oklahoma also produced a likely intense tornado that remained over rural areas and was given a rating of EF-1.

    ### May 2-3

    Scattered but very intense supercells continued to form across the Great Plains states into early May, with Texas seeing the brunt of the tornadic activity. The majority of this activity can be attributed to several weak atmospheric disturbances moving into Texas and interacting with the dryline, which is a pseudo-frontal boundary that separates very dry air masses from moist air masses and is common to West Texas. The strongest tornado to occur from this activity was in Jones County, Texas on May 2nd, where a high-end EF-3 tornado destroyed several homes and injured four people near Hawley. This tornado was well-documented by storm chasers, and videos of the narrow â€˜drillbitâ€™ tornado in progress reveal intense near-surface winds in the form of multiple vortices at times. On May 3rd, an impressive supercell near Robert Lee, Texas produced a strong deviant tornado that was similar to the Hollister, Oklahoma tornado in its motion. The tornado moved to the southeast initially, but turned to the northeast and parallelled its track back to the northwest before lifting just south of the town. This tornado was in a rural area and was only rated EF-1 due to a lack of damage indicators just like the Hollister tornado was, but it also exhibited a high Vrot on the nearby radar, indicating that it was possibly much stronger than its rating implied.

    ### May 6-8

    Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms occurred across much of the eastern two thirds of CONUS from May 6-8th, 2024, with significant tornadoes occurring in several states. On May 6th, a rare High Risk (Level 5/5) for severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes, was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for much of Oklahoma. Thankfully, many of the storms did not produce the expected numerous intense tornadoes, but one storm to the northwest of Tulsa was able to tap into the volatile environment and spawn a violent and deadly EF-4 tornado. On May 7th, the more favorable conditions for tornadic storms moved into portions of the Lower Great Lakes, with the highest threat centered from Eastern Indiana and Southern Lower Michigan into Western Ohio. Several tornadoes occurred in these areas, with some classified as significant EF-2+ tornadoes. On May 8th, the threat shifted to the south, and the southern Middle Tennessee and northern Alabama area experienced a regional tornado outbreak from the mid-afternoon into the evening hours.

    ### May 21

    May 19-21st was an incredibly active stretch of severe weather in the central portion of the country, with May 21st being the worst tornadic day. The SPC issued a Moderate risk for severe weather across Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois on this day, with a 15% risk for significant tornadoes. An organized cluster of thunderstorms moved into western Iowa from Nebraska in the morning, bringing severe wind gusts, while additional storms developed along the Kansas-Nebraska border. A rare Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch was issued at midday for the majority of Iowa in anticipation of possible significant tornadoes in the state. By mid-afternoon, several supercells in southwestern Iowa moved northeast towards the Des Moines area. Multiple tornadoes were reported, including a violent and well-documented tornado near Corning and Greenfield, Iowa, where several fatalities and injuries occurred.

    ### May 23

    On May 23rd, an EF-2 tornado touched down at 7:04 PM in Jackson County, OK. The tornado produced the most damage near Duke, OK just west of Altus. The tornado lifted at 7:57 PM. There were no injuries or fatalities. This area is quite rural, so not much damage occurred when the tornado was at its strongest. Some damage occurred to power lines and a few homes, but the tornado was likely much more intense than its EF-2 rating, as the Vrot as measured by the nearby radar is tied for #17 overall in the dual-polarization radar era at 107.6 knots.

    ### May 25

    On May 25, the SPC issued a Moderate risk for severe thunderstorms over Oklahoma, Kansas, and southwestern Missouri, with a particular concern for significant tornadoes. Despite considering a High risk, uncertainties, particularly regarding storm interactions in Texas, precluded this upgrade. A particularly dangerous situation tornado watch was issued for parts of northern Texas, Oklahoma, and south-central Kansas, but the worst tornadic weather occurred to the east of this watch box. Multiple supercells developed within the tornado watch area but quickly became messy due to storm interactions. Further southeast, a discrete supercell formed north of Dallas-Fort Worth and produced a fatal nocturnal tornado. Supercells in northeastern Oklahoma, southern Missouri, and northern Arkansas were more intense, moving through the area overnight and causing intense and fatal tornadoes. By early morning, the storms merged into a line and quelled the tornado threat briefly.

    ### May 26

    The destructive stretch of severe weather continued into the afternoon and evening of May 26th, with only a couple hours of break in activity. The atmosphere quickly destabilized after the early morning round of tornadoes in southern Missouri, and this favorable air mass expanded further east into Kentucky and Illinois. Seven of the new round of tornadoes were significant, with three of them rated intense EF-3 tornadoes. Combining the early morning round of tornadoes and the afternoon round of tornadoes into one event, the SPC logged 69 filtered reports of tornadoes from Arkansas and Alabama all the way to Wisconsin and Virginia, making it one of the most widespread tornado days of the year. 

    The first EF-3 tornado occurred in south-central Missouri in the vicinity of Mountain View. This tornado missed Mountain View to the north, but caused low-end EF-3 damage to a home and EF-2 damage a couple of others along the path. A manufactured home was also completely destroyed before the tornado lifted east of Mountain View. Several trees were snapped or uprooted along the path as well. 

    The second EF-3 tornado of this portion of the outbreak occurred near Goreville, Illinois. A security camera on Newton Lane captured the formation of this tornado. As it crossed I-57, it snapped large tree limbs and damaged an outbuilding. The tornado was filmed again crossing I-24 northeast of Goreville. Along Illinois Highway 37, it caused roof damage to two homes, snapped wooden power poles, and inflicted extreme damage on nearby trees, with debarking noted on a few near the intersection with Orchard Lane. A home on Orchard Lane suffered significant damage, losing its roof and most of its exterior walls, and a nearby outbuilding was destroyed along with several large trees. Approaching the Eagle Point Bay subdivision on Lake of Egypt, the tornado snapped several large trees and wooden telephone poles. It severely damaged or destroyed two manufactured homes, injuring one resident. Another house had its roof uplifted and was slightly moved on its foundation. As the tornado moved east-southeast into the subdivision, it weakened and dissipated, causing mainly tree damage and minor roof damage to homes along John Able Drive and Thunderhead Drive. This tornado was well-documented throughout its life by chasers and locals.

    The final EF-3 tornado of this portion of the outbreak was also the strongest, and occurred near Dawson Springs, Kentucky. This tornado paralleled I-69 for much of its path, striking areas previously hit by the December 10, 2021 Western Kentucky EF-4 tornado. It touched down at 8:01 PM CDT just northeast of Eddyville, and moved eastward, snapping trees and damaging a home at high-end EF-1 intensity. Turning northeast, it reached low-end EF-2 intensity, severely damaging a home and destroying outbuildings. In Caldwell County, the tornado prompted the first of four tornado emergencies as a debris ball appeared on radar. It weakened to high-end EF-1 intensity, snapping trees and damaging power poles before briefly strengthening to high-end EF-2 intensity, destroying a mobile home and unroofing another. The tornado weekend slightly before intensifying again to high-end EF-2 intensity north of Princeton, snapping power poles and large trees. Several homes suffered severe damage in Hopkins County, with roofs ripped off and exterior walls knocked down. Just north of the previously devastated city of Dawson Springs, it reached high-end EF-3 strength, leveling a home. As it continued, it leveled more homes, destroyed outbuildings, and snapped trees. It reached low-end EF-3 intensity again northeast of Dawson Springs, flattening poorly-anchored homes. A home was destroyed at EF-3 intensity northwest of St. Charles, resulting in one death and one injury before weakening to high-end EF-1 strength. It snapped trees and reached high-end EF-3 intensity in Barnsley, flattening homes and obliterating mobile homes, before dissipating north of Mortons Gap at 9:15 PM CDT. The tornado traveled over 35 miles, and caused one fatality and 21 injuries.

    ### May 30

    The spring 2024 tornado season concluded dramatically when a dangerous supercell struck the Midland-Odessa, Texas area on May 30th, prompting the Midland NWS office to issue its first-ever tornado emergency. The first notable severe weather from the cell was an area of damaging straight-line winds originating near Midland International Airport at 5:15 PM CDT, where estimated peak winds reached 120 mph. This powerful downburst caused extensive damage to power infrastructure and buildings as it moved southwest, impacting areas along Highway 80 and County Road 172. A double-wide mobile home was overturned, resulting in two injuries. The path of this wind event spanned approximately 11 miles, with a maximum width of 3400 yards.

    Shortly after, a tornado touched down near Warfield at 5:10 PM CDT, rated low-end EF-2.The tornado initially caused minor damage but intensified as it crossed Interstate 20, damaging power poles, buildings, and RVs along its 10.5 mile path before dissipating at 5:41 PM CDT. This tornado also spawned a smaller satellite tornado to the east, which did not cause any reported damage. Later that evening, a more powerful tornado, rated EF-3 with peak winds estimated at 140 MPH, formed near the Midland/Upton County line at 6:40 PM CDT. This tornado was unusual as it moved westward, causing significant damage to vegetation, power poles, and heavy oil equipment over a 5.4 mile path before weakening and dissipating at 7:05 PM CDT. The tornado's intensity was such that it caused ground scouring and extensive damage in its wake. Fortunately, no fatalities were reported from this severe weather event.
