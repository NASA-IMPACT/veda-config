    ### Overview

    The Spring 2024 tornado season was one of the most active on record in the United States. As of May 31st, there have been 938 tornadoes confirmed in the United States. The vast majority of these occurred in the meteorological spring months of March-May (49 in March, 327 in April, and 473 in May), placing this period within the 90th percentile of activity compared to climatological averages. This three-month period was responsible for 36 fatalities, hundreds of injuries, and was the second most prolific tornado season since at least 1950â€“second only to the deadly 2011 tornado season. Three tornadoes were rated violent EF-4s with wind speeds from 166-200 mph, and 28 were rated as intense EF-3s with wind speeds from 136-165 mph.

    ### March 14

    On Thursday, March 14th, 2024, several devastating tornadoes carved paths of destruction across eastern Indiana and Western and Central Ohio. Two of these were rated as intense EF-3s on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and were responsible for all of the fatalities seen from this severe weather outbreak. Two primary supercell thunderstorms formed in central Indiana and moved eastward. The first, located further north, produced five tornadoes during its path from Adams County, Indiana to Licking County, Ohio during the afternoon to early evening hours. The second storm, situated further south, produced two tornadoes later in the evening from Delaware County, Indiana to Miami County, Ohio. There were also two other cyclic thunderstorms that produced a combined three tornadoes in northern Ohio from this event. Overall, this regional tornado outbreak is responsible for 11 tornadoes across Indiana and Ohio, causing 4 fatalities and 68 injuries.
