    ### Overview

    The Spring 2024 tornado season was one of the most active on record in the United States. As of May 31st, there have been 938 tornadoes confirmed in the United States. The vast majority of these occurred in the meteorological spring months of March-May (49 in March, 327 in April, and 473 in May), placing this period within the 90th percentile of activity compared to climatological averages. This three-month period was responsible for 36 fatalities, hundreds of injuries, and was the second most prolific tornado season since at least 1950â€“second only to the deadly 2011 tornado season. Three tornadoes were rated violent EF-4s with wind speeds from 166-200 mph, and 28 were rated as intense EF-3s with wind speeds from 136-165 mph.
