    ### Overview

    The Spring 2024 tornado season was one of the most active on record in the United States. As of May 31st, there were 1,176 tornadoes confirmed in the United States. The vast majority of these occurred in the meteorological spring months of March-May (Table 1), placing this period within the 90th percentile of activity compared to climatological averages. This three-month period was responsible for 36 fatalities, hundreds of injuries, and was the second most prolific tornado season since at least 1950â€“second only to the deadly 2011 tornado season. Through the end of May, severe thunderstorms alone accounted for nearly $42 billion in damage across the United States, with four tornado outbreaks during the spring attributing over $1 billion in damage each. Four tornadoes were rated violent EF-4s on the [Enhanced Fujita Scale](https://www.weather.gov/oun/efscale) with wind speeds from 166-200 mph, and 27 were rated as intense EF-3s with wind speeds from 136-165 mph.

  The National Weather Service (NWS) issued  1,728 tornado warnings across the United States from March to May, with several of these being upgraded to Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Warnings if confirmed to be large and actively damaging structures. An even smaller subset was upgraded further from PDS to Tornado Emergencies if the tornado was confirmed to be large and was directly threatening a larger population center. As a result, millions of Americans were impacted by tornado warnings during the Spring of 2024, with the vast majority of counties in the Midwest, Southeast, and Southern Great Plains seeing a warning at least once during the three-month period. Compared to average spring severe weather seasons, the Southeast United States saw a less active season, while the Great Plains and Midwest saw a more active season.

Intense tornadoes are defined as those that receive an EF-3 rating or higher. From March through May of 2024, there were a total of 31 intense tornadoes (Table 2). About half of these intense tornadoes inflicted fatalities, and the majority of them caused injuries. The combined damage paths of these tornadoes exceeded an astounding 630 miles throughout the Midwest, Southeast, and Great Plains.

    ### Datasets Utilized
    The far-reaching impacts of the Spring 2024 tornado season can be seen in analyzing several dataset types, including satellite remote sensing, ground-based observations, and post-storm damage survey data.
  </Prose>
</Block>

<Block type='wide'>
  <Prose>
    
    [**PlanetScope**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/data-catalog/ps-tornadoes-2024)
    
    Planet Labsâ€™ commercial SmallSat imagery provides high-resolution satellite data crucial for assessing areas heavily damaged by tornadoes. With frequent overpasses, it allows for quick identification of destroyed buildings, vegetation damage, and blocked roads. If skies are clear directly after a tornado strike, first responders can use this data to better serve affected communities. This imagery was also used in this story to analyze reflectance changes in visible bands before and after a tornado, pinpointing areas of intense damageâ€”even down to the building level, thanks to Planet's high spatial resolution.

    [**NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/data-catalog/tornadoes-2024-tracks)
    
    The NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT) is a geographic information system (GIS)-hosted dataset where post-storm damage survey results are uploaded and referenced to the location where each description of damage occurred. This dataset includes center lines of all tornado tracks, polygons that break down the EF rating at each point along the path, descriptions of the damage at each survey location, and ground damage pictures of the damage at most entry points. 
 
    [**WSR-88D**](https://www.weather.gov/iwx/wsr_88d) **and** [**Doppler On Wheels**](http://www.cswr.org/contents/aboutdows.php)  
    
    The Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR-88D) is a network of radars used by the NWS to monitor weather patterns, including tornadoes, across large areas. In addition, the Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radar, which is mounted on vehicles and can get closer to storms, was examined in cases where it was deployed in order to gather more detailed information. DOW radars are typically used for research and can capture clearer, higher-resolution data on tornadoes, while WSR-88D provides a wider view but with slightly less detail.

    [**Black Marble Night Lights**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/data-catalog/nightlights-tornadoes-2024) 
    
    NASAâ€™s Black Marble night lights dataset provides satellite images of Earth at night, capturing the light pollution from cities, roads, and other human activity. These images are collected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, and can be used to examine changes in illumination over time. In this story, night lights data is used to assess changes before and after a tornado impacts a town, highlighting areas affected by power outages that may cause recovery slowdowns.

    ### March 14

    On Thursday, March 14th, 2024, 11 tornadoes carved paths of destruction across eastern Indiana and Western and Central Ohio, resulting in 4 fatalities and 68 injuries. Two tornadoes were rated as intense EF-3s and were responsible for all of the fatalities. The cause of most of these tornadoes were two supercell thunderstorms that formed in central Indiana and moved eastward. The first, located further north, produced five tornadoes during its more than 120-mile path from Adams County, Indiana to Licking County, Ohio. The second storm, situated further south, produced two tornadoes along its more than 75-mile path from Delaware County, Indiana to Miami County, Ohio. In addition, two other cyclic thunderstorms produced a combined three tornadoes in northern Ohio from this event.

    ### April 26

    After a relatively calm period of weather in the United States, the tornado outbreak on April 26th triggered an extremely active phase of severe weather with 76 confirmed tornadoes across the United States, resulting in 1 fatality and 16 injuries. On the day before the tornado outbreak, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Level 3/5 Enhanced Risk of severe weather, including tornadoes, over eastern Nebraska, western Iowa, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. This risk delineation was maintained into the day of the outbreak. A broken line of supercell thunderstorms produced several significant tornadoes in the Enhanced risk zone, with the strongest being an EF-4 that resulted in the issuance of a rare Tornado Emergency for West Elkhorn, Nebraska. In the Omaha, Nebraska NWS County Warning Area, this tornado outbreak was responsible for the second largest daily tornado count since at least 1950, and produced the strongest tornadoes for the region since 2014.

    ##### Lincoln, NE EF-3
    The first intense tornado of the day struck near 84th Street in Lincoln, Nebraska, carving an 8.6-mile path through Lancaster County with winds up to 158 mph. Touching down around 2:52 PM and lifting at 3:04 PM, the tornado caused significant damage, 3 injuries, and no fatalities. Shortly after forming, it hit a business and large transmission line, severely damaged a manufacturing plant, and threw cars up to 100 yards. It continued causing significant damage by derailing a train, snapping tree trunks, and scattering debris before weakening near 141st Street.

    ##### West Elkhorn, NE EF-4
    Shortly after the Lincoln EF-3 tornado lifted, a more violent tornado struck the northwestern Omaha suburbs, moving through Douglas and Washington Counties in Nebraska and into Harrison County, Iowa. On the ground for over 31 miles with winds up to 170 mph, the tornado caused extensive damage. It began near West Q Road, quickly intensifying as it crossed highways, damaging homes, and overturning farm equipment. After crossing the Elkhorn River, it leveled four houses in western Elkhorn and expanded to one mile in width, snapping power poles and trees. The tornado then moved through residential areas, causing damage in Bennington and inflicting severe damage to rural homes in Washington County before weakening and lifting near Modale, Iowa. Although there were no fatalities reported, there were multiple injuries.

    ##### Minden-Harlan, IA EF-3
    The final intense tornado of the day, likely stronger than its official rating, hit Pottawattamie and Shelby Counties in Iowa, covering 40.9 miles with peak winds of 160 mph. Beginning at 5:25 PM and lifting at 6:29 PM, the tornado caused one fatality and three injuries. Starting east of McClelland, the tornado intensified near Sycamore Road and grew to 800 yards wide as it approached Minden, causing severe EF-3 damage to homes and buildings. Multiple vortices were observed in Minden, where it caused the most destruction, leading to all of the reported casualties. Northeast of Minden, it widened to nearly a mile, flipping a semi-truck on Interstate 80 and damaging homes, trees, and vehicles along the way. Near Harlan, Doppler radar detected wind speeds up to 224 mph just above the ground, suggesting potential for EF-5 damage. The tornado weakened near Defiance, eventually dissipating at the Crawford-Shelby county line, with radar indicating it may have continued briefly into Crawford County.

    ### May 6-8

    Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms occurred across much of the eastern two thirds of CONUS from May 6-8th, 2024, with significant tornadoes occurring in several states. On May 6th, a rare High Risk (Level 5/5) for severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes, was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for much of Oklahoma. Thankfully, many of the storms did not produce the expected numerous intense tornadoes, but one storm to the northwest of Tulsa was able to tap into the volatile environment and spawn a violent and deadly EF-4 tornado. On May 7th, the more favorable conditions for tornadic storms moved into portions of the Lower Great Lakes, with the highest threat centered from Eastern Indiana and Southern Lower Michigan into Western Ohio. Several tornadoes occurred in these areas, with some classified as significant EF-2+ tornadoes. On May 8th, the threat shifted to the south, and the southern Middle Tennessee and northern Alabama area experienced a regional tornado outbreak from the mid-afternoon into the evening hours.

    ##### May 6: Barnsdall, OK EF-4
    The only notable tornado on May 6th was a violent EF-4 that impacted the town of Barnsdall, Oklahoma. The tornado caused severe damage to homes and the wax plant on the townâ€™s east side, with winds estimated at 150-175 mph. As it moved northeast, the storm continued damaging trees, homes, and outbuildings. By the time it reached Bartlesville, the tornado weakened to EF-2, but still caused impactful damage in the city. The storm eventually dissipated northeast of Bartlesville after traveling around 40 miles, causing two fatalities and injuring 33 people.

    ##### May 7: Michigan and Ohio Significant Tornadoes
    During the mid-afternoon of May 7th in southwest Lower Michigan, several intense storms impacted areas south of Kalamazoo, prompting the first Tornado Emergency issuance in Michigan history. The storm system produced two EF-2s, two EF-1s, and a brief EF-UNK just inside the northern Indiana border. The first EF-2 touched down near Centreville, causing extensive tree and property damage and destroying parts of several homes north of Sherwood. At its peak, video confirmed the tornado to be of multiple-vortex type - a tornado with smaller circulations orbiting the main funnel, intensifing local damage along the tornado's path. The second EF-2 tornado struck Portage, traveling 11 miles through the city. It damaged homes, businesses, mobile home parks, and apartment complexes, uprooting hundreds of trees and causing a section of an industrial warehouse roof to collapse. Sixteen people were injured, making it Michigan's strongest tornado since the Gaylord EF-3 in 2022.

In central and eastern Indiana, the storms on May 7th had difficulty producing tornadoes initially. However, as the storms moved from southeastern Indiana through Ohio into western Pennsylvania, 29 tornadoes were spawned. The strongest were in west-central and far eastern Ohio, where three EF-2 and several high-end EF-1 tornadoes touched down. One storm led to a PDS tornado warning for the Oxford, Ohio area, north of Cincinnati.

Ohio's first significant tornado of the day formed west of Coldwater, Ohio and was rated an EF-2. This large, wedge-shaped tornado caused major tree damage along the Wabash River, destroying barns and outbuildings in Mercer County before it weakened and lifted near Coldwater. Shortly after, another EF-2 tornado touched down north of Chickasaw, damaging fields, tearing up two farm properties, and causing roof and wall damage. Just to the south in Darke County, a high-end EF-1 tornado moved into Greenville, causing minor damage to homes and trees. The tornado was at peak intensity when it moved into the Greenville City Park, destroying trees and damaging the nearby high schoolâ€™s football stadium before weakening and lifting north of Gettysburg.

    In northern Alabama, the Huntsville area experienced its third-largest recorded tornado outbreak, with 20 tornadoes, including two EF-3s and one EF-2. The event unfolded in two waves: the first, from supercell storms around 8 PM until midnight, and the second, from a line of storms between 3 and 5:15 AM on May 9. Notable tornadoes included the Melton Bluff EF-3, which damaged homes along its 3.8-mile path, the Huntsville/Monte Sano EF-2, which struck highly populated areas, and the Henegar EF-3, which caused seven injuriesâ€”the highest for the event. Despite the widespread destruction, northern Alabama reported no fatalities, though eight people were injured across the state.

    ### May 21

    May 19-21st was an incredibly active stretch of severe weather in the central portion of the country, with May 21st being the worst tornadic day. The SPC issued a Moderate risk for severe weather across Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois on this day, with a 15% risk for significant tornadoes. An organized cluster of thunderstorms moved into western Iowa from Nebraska in the morning, bringing severe wind gusts, while additional storms developed along the Kansas-Nebraska border. A rare Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch was issued at midday for the majority of Iowa in anticipation of possible significant tornadoes in the state. By mid-afternoon, several supercells in southwestern Iowa moved northeast towards the Des Moines area. Multiple tornadoes were reported, including a violent and well-documented tornado near Corning and Greenfield, Iowa, where several fatalities and injuries occurred.

##### Greenfield, IA EF-4

The strongest tornado of the day (and also of the year), was a violent EF-4 tornado that tore through Iowaâ€™s Page, Taylor, Adams, and Adair counties during the mid-afternoon. The tornado first touched down near Villisca in Page County, causing EF-1 damage before clipping Taylor County and entering Adams County. North of Corning, the tornado reached EF-2 strength, destroying an outbuilding and part of a home, with a car being tossed on Iowa 148, resulting in one fatality. The storm intensified to high-end EF-3 near 150th Street in Adams County, where it leveled a cinder block home and toppled wind turbines, all while being captured by storm chasers documenting its intense, multiple vortex structure.

As the tornado moved into Adair County, it strengthened to low-end EF-4, leveling homes and outbuildings before turning toward Greenfield, where it inflicted mid-range EF-4 damage with peak winds estimated by the NWS to be 185 mph. In Greenfield, dozens of homes and mobile homes were destroyed, resulting in four additional fatalities and 35 injuries. After devastating Greenfield, the tornado rapidly weakened and lifted just east of the municipal airport, leaving behind a 44-mile path of destruction, five fatalities, and 35 injuries.

  Comparison of DOW-collected ground-based velocities and correlation coefficient values from the Greenfield, Iowa EF-4 tornado on May 21, 2024. Negative velocity values indicate the wind is moving towards the radar, while positive values indicate the wind is moving away from the radar. Lower values of correlation coefficient indicate the the radar beam is being returned by non-meteorological targets (not precipitiation), which in this case is debris being thrown into the air by the violent tornado.

A nearby DOW vehicle initially recorded winds possibly reaching 290 mph at only 44 meters above the ground in the eastern part of Greenfield. Further investigation into this data revealed that a brief one-second gust within the vortex contained astonishingly high winds of 308-319 mph. This DOW data suggests that the Greenfield, Iowa EF-4 tornado produced the third-highest measured winds recorded in history.

    ### A Spring of Records

    The Spring 2024 tornado season broke several local, regional, and national records in the meteorology community, further cementing its place in U.S. severe weather history. Some of these records include:

    * The state of Ohio tied its previous annual record of 62 tornadoes by early June and has since well surpassed it by the time of this publication.
    * The state of Oklahoma experienced the most April tornadoes ever recorded, with 55 tornadoes confirmed. Several event-specific records were broken as well. 
    * Charleston, West Virginiaâ€™s NWS County Warning Area set a new record for tornadoes in a single event on April 2nd. 
    * The state of Arkansas witnessed a state record for tornado width on May 25th. 
    * Omaha, Nebraskaâ€™s NWS County Warning Area saw the most tornado warnings ever issued in a single day on April 26th.
    * Huntsville, Alabamaâ€™s NWS County Warning Area  saw its third most tornadoes in a day in their coverage area on May 7th. 
    * The Greenfield, Iowa tornadic winds measured by DOW are the third-highest measured winds in history, just behind the infamous 1999 Moore and 2013 El Reno, Oklahoma tornadoes

    Overall, the March-May period saw the second-highest tornado count in the United States since 1950, with only the historic 2011 season surpassing it. This historic season will be remembered not only for its destructive tornadoes but also for its unprecedented numbers, significantly impacting both communities and weather forecasting records across the United States.
