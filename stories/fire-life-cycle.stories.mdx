  ## Introduction
  <mark>ðŸš§ This Discovery presents work in progress and not peer-reviewed results! ðŸš§</mark>

  Fires are an integral part of the Earth system and have a large human dimension. Society's interaction with the Earth system affects fire risk, fire spread, and fire impacts (e.g. property destruction, emissions, mud slides). NASA data products and models provide real-time information on active fires, smoke, air quality, and forecasts of changing fire weather and seasonal fire risk.

  EIS provides a platform for collaborative analysis of and decision support for pre-fire risk, active fire situational awareness, and managing post-fire impacts. The full potential of these individual efforts are realized through the EIS collaborative framework to support new transdisciplinary connections and fire-related management activities.

  Join the discussion and provide comments on this Discovery in [EIS GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Earth-Information-System/discussions/8).

    ## Fires in Western U.S.

    Catastrophic wildfires are on increase across the Western United States. While fires constitute an important rangeland disturbance process in the semi-arid ecosystems of the Western U.S., climate change and intensifying droughts have increased the frequency and vigor of wildfires.

    This chart shows total area burned from 1984 to 2020 in the Western U.S.

    ## Intensifying Fire Severity and Increasing Burned Area

    Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity ([MTBS] (https://www.mtbs.gov/)) program provides long record of CONUS wildland fires during 1984-2021, mapping burn area extents, date of ignition, and burn severity at 30 m resolution. The intensifying fire season can be seen with larger and more intense fires in 2020 when compared to 2016.

    ## Drought Conditions Set the Stage for an Intense Fire Season in California in 2021

	The 2021 wildfire season in California started amid an ongoing drought and historically low rainfall and reservoir levels. By August, seasonal deficits of rainfall result in anomalously dry soils in large parts of the Western U.S. Eventually, the vegetation dried out as the roots couldn't provide moisture to meet atmospheric demand. This vegetation stress is captured as reduced plant growth by thermal imaging satellites and the Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) using the Goddard [Land Information System (LIS)](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) framework.

    ## Developments in Fire Risk Modeling

    Dry, windy weather combines with the dry vegetation to create perfect conditions for WildFires across much of Northern California in the summer of 2021. One way to track the increased risk of fires over large areas is through the use of indices based on weather, vegetation and soil conditions. Two examples of this are the globally used Fire Weather Index (FWI) and the US-focused National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS).  Traditionally, these indices are based on readily available weather station data which limits their spatial detail and sensitivity to soil and vegetation conditions.

    EIS will explore the integration of more detailed land surface information, from models and satellites, with existing weather-based fire-risk indices.

    ## Impacts on Hydrology - A Journey Across Fires

    Response of vegetation to fire disturbances is a complex interplay of climate conditions, landcover, and burn severity. [OpenET](https://openetdata.org/) observations of ET ([DisALEXI model](https://openetdata.org/methodologies/)) capture the decline in ET after the fire. The progression of spatially-averaged ET over the burned and control regions (unimpacted from fire) show the post-fire recovery of vegetation.

    Below are three recent fire events showing these ET recovery trends.

    Ignited on July 24, 2017, the Preacher fire burned ~5000 ac of grassland with moderate severity. OpenET data show vegetation responded with declining ET, but transpiration recovered within a couple of post-fire seasons.

    ## 2018 Natchez Fire in Northern California
    The Natchez fire started on July 15, 2018 and burned a massive 38,800 ac of forested landscape with high severity. Post-fire ET data show that vegetation sustained the impact on ET for a longer period of time, with incomplete recovery even after three post-fire seasons.

    ## 2017 Thomas Fire in Southern California

    On Dec 4, 2017, the Thomas fire burned 281,982 acres surpassing all preceding wildfires in modern California history, causing over $2.2 billion USD in damages. A mix of savannas and grasslands sustained moderate severity burns. Recovery was still incomplete by the end of 2021 (based on most recently available OpenET data).

    ## Ecosystem response to fires is complex!

    Recovery of severely burnt forests is slowest and can sustain damage over multiple seasons, even in near normal or wet conditions.
    High severity fires caused highest ET suppression with slowest recovery over three post-fire years

    Post-fire management and risk assessment thus need to include the control of landcover, fire properties,  and climate disturbances in studying the hydrology of burnt and surrounding regions.

    ## Downstream Effects of Fire on Debris Flow Risk

   Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is an early observational indicator of interest to emergency response providers to prioritize areas with increased risk of mud-slides.

   Burn Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) maps from the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) program are one of the main products used to assess post-fire debris flow risk. Maximum FRP per 12hr fire line segment shows strong spatial relationship with BARC for the Thomas Fire of 2017 in the maps below.
