  Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and is the second-largest contributor to rising global temperatures after carbon dioxide (CO₂). Yet the sources of methane are not as well understood as CO₂, and NASA scientists are responding to that challenge by expanding missions and putting instruments to work in new ways.

  Two key technologies have made recent steps to meet the need for methane measurements. The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) project is expanding its methane detection from space, and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) test flights are helping to improve scientific understanding of sources of methane.

        ## EMIT Expands Operations with a Renewed Focus on Methane
        EMIT is a NASA instrument aboard the International Space Station. It was initially designed to measure the effects of mineral dust on the climate, but this versatile instrument has many capabilities, including detection of methane plumes from large emission events. Now [the EMIT mission will be extended for an additional three years](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/emit/nasas-emit-will-explore-diverse-science-questions-on-extended-mission/), with methane observations as one of its primary focus areas.

                The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, instrument was installed on the port side of the International Space Station's truss structure in July 2022. EMIT began as a mineral dust source observation experiment, though the mission has recently been extended for three years, enabling it to focus on detecting methane emissions.

        “The extended mission is particularly exciting,” said Dr. Andrew Thorpe, a Research Technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Initially, EMIT only took measurements over parts of the world that produced large amounts of dust, like deserts. Coincidentally, some of these desert regions also contained large methane plumes, such as emissions from oil and gas operations in the Middle East. EMIT also detected large methane plumes coming from landfills within arid regions. “But we want to see beyond that,” said Thorpe. “EMIT will soon have near global coverage, and that’s tremendous.”

        This work is particularly beneficial because in some cases methane leaks can be repaired. Rapid detection of leaks can help facility operators, stakeholders, and decision-makers respond to large methane emissions events, thereby preventing further pollution, protecting nearby workers and communities, and supporting more efficient facility operation.

        Collecting data is an important step in understanding methane emissions, but to enable usability of the data, it must then be shared in ways that are easy to access and understand.

        To that end, an updated data viewer developed by the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) allows users to interact with a global map of large, point-source methane plumes. Users can now trace EMIT observation passes over time, quantify plumes within a selected geographic region, and use a new point-and-click tool to measure plume size in miles or kilometers.

        ## AVIRIS-3 Takes Flight to Spot Methane Sources
        Aircraft-based measurement instruments are another tool in methane detection, using a similar technology as EMIT, but on a more localized scale. “They can see smaller emissions,” said Thorpe, and because aircraft-based instruments cover a smaller area, they can produce higher resolution measurements and fill gaps in satellite data where overpasses are less frequent.

        The [AVIRIS-3](https://airbornescience.jpl.nasa.gov/instruments/aviris-3) instrument is the third generation of Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometers, and it can be flown on a variety of aircraft. Two recent collaborative airborne projects examined methane emissions for different geographic regions and sources.

        The first of these collaborations was a [two-week research effort](https://csl.noaa.gov/groups/csl3/measurements/2024ammbec/), joined by NASA, marking the launch of NOAA’s four-year [AiRMAPS](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/airmaps/) (Airborne and Remote sensing Methane and Air Pollutant Surveys) initiative. Aboard research aircraft, NOAA scientists used direct air sampling to measure the total amount of methane in the air, while NASA’s AVIRIS-3 mapped methane concentrations across the study area to pinpoint the sources of methane. The flights, which were supported by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, identified a number of large methane plumes which may be connected to sources like agriculture and landfills.

        "The state of Colorado has been a leader in managing methane emissions," said Steven Brown, Tropospheric Chemistry Program Leader with NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory. "The tiered observing system deployed this summer, including satellite remote sensing, AVIRIS flights, airborne in-situ measurements and ground based observations, will provide powerful new data to assess current methane emissions inventories for Colorado and other NOAA and NASA partners at the state level."

        Another AVIRIS-3 demonstration project measured methane plumes over the Gulf of Mexico. During a 12-day campaign, methane emissions from drilling platforms were measured by three different methods: by ship, by satellite, and from an AVIRIS-equipped aircraft. Detection of emissions over open water has historically been more challenging for satellite-based observations alone, so by leveraging different observation technologies and new methods, researchers are able to collect and validate data over wider geographic ranges. 

        Dr. Ryan Stauffer, a research scientist from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, was one of the scientists who took part in the field research. “What we did out there was very cool,” he said. “The newest instruments are getting better and better data. We’re learning more and more.”

        The AVIRIS-3 instrument was flown aboard a series of NASA [SCOAPE](https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/scoape/index.html) (Satellite Coastal and Oceanic Atmospheric Pollution Experiment) flights, in coordination with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The goal of the project was “to understand all we can about oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico,” said Stauffer.

        The science teams observed around 60 offshore platforms and identified “dozens of plumes,” according to Stauffer. “Finding and sharing information on methane leaks is low-hanging fruit in terms of supporting solutions, and in terms of reducing emissions,” he explained.

        Localized measurements are particularly useful for facility managers and stakeholders, in part because methane plumes can be spotted in real time during flyovers, allowing for swift action to remedy leaks or repair malfunctioning equipment. The spectral data is “clear as day,” said Thorpe. “It makes the invisible visible.”

        Most importantly, Stauffer explained how this work will support both public and private decision-makers. “We provide this data to help people make decisions; to help people solve problems,” he said. “This is going to be a huge benefit.”

        AVIRIS data is planned to be made available on the US GHG Center portal in 2025.
