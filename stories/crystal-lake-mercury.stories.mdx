    ## Introduction
    Over the last five decades, the land area burnt by forest fires in the western United States has increased tenfold. This trend is expected to continue and even accelerate under the influence of climate change. Given this scenario, the societal impacts of wildfires are of interest. While the impact of wildfires on the loss of human life and property is obvious, less understood are secondary environmental impacts that affect regions remote from the location of the fires. For example, recent studies show that smoke from wildfires is expected to become the major air pollutant in the United States. However, less understood is the potential impact of wildfires on water quality.
