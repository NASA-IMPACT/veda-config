    Environmental Justice (EJ) advocates for a fair distribution of environmental benefits and risks, regardless of race, color, or socioeconomic status [1]. In places such as Dallas, where proximity to landfills significantly impact health outcomes, environmental justice principles become especially relevant. 

    Since the General Accounting Office (GAO) published “Siting Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities,”  researchers from various disciplines such as law, sociology, public policy, geosciences, and economics have explored such relationships, using various measures of exposure, spatial scales, and statistical controls. Consistently, these studies have shown that while air quality has improved in the United States over the past several decades, people of color (POC), particularly Black and Hispanic American populations, bear an unequal burden of the environmental impacts stemming from landfills. Moreover, research into the roles of race and income have highlighted race as the most significant factor in determining exposure to environmental hazards. As with other EJ concerns, the underlying causes of systemic disparities in racial/ethnic air pollution exposure are complex and intertwined with historical patterns of exclusion and discrimination, perpetuating cycles of injustice that manifest in impacts on health, urban planning, and real estate values.

    The disparities in environmental burdens stem from practices such as freeway construction, redlining, and other forms of discrimination that have marginalized communities of color, displacing them from their support networks and clustering them in neighborhoods lacking resources but rife with health hazards. Initiated by the federally sponsored Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s, these maps categorized neighborhoods into four grades based on security for emergency home lending: A (most desirable), B (still desirable), C (declining), and D (hazardous, i.e., redlined). Racial redlining effectively marked Black and brown neighborhoods as risky and unsuitable for loans, depriving them of essential infrastructure such as sewer and water systems. Despite the Fair Housing Act banning racial discrimination in housing in 1968, the legacy of explicit racial discrimination persists, shaping patterns of racial residential segregation today.  For instance, redlining, a historically discriminatory federal mortgage appraisal policy from the 1930s, continues to correlate with present-day air pollution disparities across 202 U.S. cities. For example, in 64% of grade D neighborhoods, the majority (>50%) of the population comprises people of color (POC), and in 74% of these neighborhoods, the median income is low to moderate. Redlining designations correlate with various exposures, including greenspace prevalence, tree canopy coverage, urban-heat exposure disparities, and health effects such as asthma, cancer, adverse birth outcomes, and overall urban health.

    Landfills are created for responsible waste disposal, and operate under federal regulations. While hazardous waste is federally regulated, individual states are responsible for establishing criteria for how non-hazardous  landfills operate and for monitoring compliance. Despite these regulations, they contribute to air and water pollution, with toxic substances seeping into groundwater. Environmental impacts of landfills include air pollution, aesthetic degradation, soil contamination, and water quality reduction, as well as unintended hosting of wildlife. Additionally, landfills generate significant noise pollution from heavy machinery and truck traffic, which further diminishes property values. Heavy truck traffic noise lowers property value by 30 to 50 times more than car traffic, as trucks emit noise levels 16 times louder than cars from a distance of 50 feet. 

    Methane, a byproduct of decomposing organic matter, is a significant contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Landfills are one of the top three contributors to methane emissions in the USA. Despite constituting only a fraction of total human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, methane possesses significant heat-trapping capacity, approximately 80 times greater per pound than carbon dioxide. Consequently, reductions in methane emissions yield a more immediate impact on global warming. The gas is odorless and colorless, making leaks extremely difficult to detect, thus requiring the addition of mercaptan to natural gas for leak detection in homes. Continuous exposure to very high concentrations of methane can lead to adverse health effects, including loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, and even fatality. Thus, identifying specific methane emission sources is a critical step in addressing this issue. By pinpointing major emitters of methane plumes can swiftly take action to mitigate emissions.

    ###Data Analysis

    Despite extensive research on the positive correlation between environmental hazards and race and poverty, the perceived extent and scale of its impact has been confined to local scales. Data analysis through NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) maps from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offer valuable insights. Methane plumes from landfills in Dallas and Stockton in particular draw attention, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the issue.

    1. Observations from space using NASA’s missions like EMIT can be used to detect methane super-emitters. EMIT is an imaging spectrometer that records visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) light reflected from the surface of Earth’s arid dust source regions to better understand the surface mineral composition, the resulting composition of emitted dust, and consequently, its impact on heating and cooling Earth’s atmosphere and surface. In addition to its primary objective, EMIT has demonstrated the capacity to characterize methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) point-source emissions by measuring gas absorption features in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The EMIT Level 2B Methane detection products can be used to identify and quantify areas of high methane enhancement in the atmosphere at the time of EMIT’s observation. 

    2. SVI maps from the CDC indicate areas of relatively higher social disparities, which can highlight areas with greater vulnerability of the population. SVI includes the following 4 themes: Socioeconomic Status (Below Poverty, Unemployed, Income, No High School Diploma), Household Composition & Disability (Aged 65 or Older, Aged 17 or Younger, Civilian with a Disability, Single-Parent Households), Minority Status & Language (Minority, Speaks English “Less than Well”), and Housing Type & Transportation (Multi-Unit Structures, Mobile Homes, Crowding, No Vehicle, Group Quarters). The raster layers store the SVI values, which range from 0 to 1. In the SVI, low values represent low vulnerability while high values represent high vulnerability. 

    We identified four significant methane plumes from EMIT from landfills in Stockton, California (1) and Dallas, Texas (3). Zooming in on a particular area of various figures below shows that landfills emitting large methane plumes are disproportionately located in vulnerable communities. These populations, both in Stockton and Dallas, are characterized by individuals below the poverty line, unemployed, with low income and no high school diploma, living in multi-unit structures or mobile homes, and facing language barriers.

    ### Dallas

    Dallas is the largest metropolitan area in Texas and the fourth largest in the United States. The DFW has experienced a consistent increased rate in population growth and diversity. According to 2023 census data, Dallas’s 1,299,544 residents are 42.2% Hispanic, 3.7% Asian, 28.3% non-Hispanic white, and 23.6% black (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/).  

    A 2020 study “Poisoned by Zip Code” by Evelyn Mayo [https://paulquinn.edu/urban-research-initiative/] reveals a 15-year life expectancy difference between predominantly white and wealthier zip codes and those inhabited by black and brown residents in southern Dallas. Zoning policies concentrating air pollution in communities of color contribute to this health disparity. Also, the finding reveals that the census tracts hosting landfill sites in the Dallas area have lower property values than the non-host areas. The affordability of these neighborhoods' properties associated with these reduced property values closer to the landfills may have attracted low-income minority populations.

    ### Stockton

    Located in the heart of California’s Central Valley and connected to the San Francisco Bay by the San Joaquin River, Stockton is a port city and an agricultural hub. As such, the city has been a point for siting heavy industry and major transportation infrastructure. Demographically, Stockton is one of the most diverse cities in the state. According to 2023 census data, Stockton’s 321,819 residents are 45.2% Hispanic, 20.9% Asian, 17.6% non-Hispanic white, and 11.6% black (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/). Unfortunately, this diverse community suffers from higher levels of poverty and unemployment than the rest of the state.

    Stockton residents live with a significant air pollution burden and one of the highest childhood asthma rates in the state. By Clean Air Act National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the region is in “Serious Nonattainment” – the highest classification possible – for PM2.5 air concentrations, and “Extreme Nonattainment” – the highest classification possible – for ozone air concentrations. The human impacts of this negative air quality are substantial: a nationwide study placed Stockton 12th on a list of the top U.S. cities impacted by PM2.5 concentrations, responsible for 61 excess deaths and over 50,000 “adversely impacted days” (days where people missed school and work or otherwise needed to restrict their activity) in 2017 alone.
