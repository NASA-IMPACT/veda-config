    ### Introduction
    Pork producers in eastern North Carolina call the stench of pig waste “the smell of money” but to the local residents, it’s the scent of injustice and racism. The proliferation of hog farms in this area has raised significant environmental justice concerns, particularly within low socioeconomic status communities. Primarily composed of minority populations, these communities face disproportionate exposure to the harmful effects of Concentrated Animal Farming Operations (CAFOs). These operations impose an environmental burden encompassing a wide range of issues, including air and water pollution, noxious odors, and compromised public health. Residents endure heightened risks of respiratory ailments, water contamination, and reduced quality of life due to the intensive confinement systems and waste management practices employed by these farms. The distribution of these facilities also typically intersects with historically marginalized neighborhoods: Black North Carolinians are 1.54x as likely as white residents to live within three miles of a hog farm. This exacerbates pre-existing disparities in access to clean air, water, and environmental resources. 

    For decades, hog farm production in southeastern North Carolina has posed significant environmental concerns. The number of hog farms has been steadily increasing– in some areas, hogs outnumber humans 35-1– leading to a rise in waste generated by these Concentrated Animal Farming Operations (CAFOs). Waste is typically collected in lagoons or vats, where it is often transferred to nearby fields to be sprayed as fertilizer or converted to biogas. Disasters such as Hurricane Florence in 2018 have exacerbated the issue and caused these lagoons to overflow and leak into local water supply, creating an environmental issue for socially vulnerable people in this region. Most CAFOs in southeastern North Carolina are housed in or near socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. 

    Note that in the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) map in Figure 1, the values are sorted into four separate categories with category 1 (0.0 - 0.25) being the least vulnerable and category 4 (>0.75) being the most socially vulnerable, or binned SVI values. The hog farm inventory map from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Figure 2 shows the concentration of hog farms in southeastern North Carolina located in the same region where the vulnerable communities are located.

    ### Methane vs SVI

    Note that in the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) map in Figure 1, the values are sorted into four separate categories with category 1 (0.0 - 0.25) being the least vulnerable and category 4 (>0.75) being the most socially vulnerable, or binned SVI values.

    Hog farm production waste poses a dual threat to both the local water supply and air quality. Chemicals like methane and ammonia are released into the atmosphere while waste is sprayed on fields as a fertilizer. Wind catches this waste and spreads it over the neighboring area, blanketing it in a layer of feces, urine, pus, and blood. The pervasive odor from these lagoons makes basic outdoor activities and chores challenging for communities in these regions. Not only do these chemicals cause foul odors, they can also be responsible for short-term and long-term health risks. A 2021 report from Duplin County, NC found that about 89 premature deaths per year can be attributed to hog farm emissions.  

    Short-Term Health Risks:
    - Nausea and Vomiting
    - Asthma
    - Headaches

    Long-Term Health Risks:
    - Cancer
    - Increased Infant Mortality Rate
    - Anemia
    - Kidney Disease
    - Tuberculosis
    - Septicemia

    However, the impact of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) extends beyond health issues. Ammonium released into the atmosphere from these lagoons can convert to nitrogen, contributing to the potential for acid rain in affected communities. This environmental impact disproportionately affects historically vulnerable communities. Local legislation has made attempts to limit the hazards; however, because pork production generates an estimated $10 billion per year and creates more 40,000 jobs, there has been little interest in passing more aggressive measures. This leaves those that live in these communities with little hope of a better quality of life. It is even challenging for people in this area to move away because the odor and pollution issue has decreased the value of their homes so much that they are not able to sell them.

    In response to complaints about the stench and waste, producers such as Smithfield have pivoted to creating “biogas” from the waste lagoons. Biogas, or biological natural gas, is the result of a refining process in which sealed, oxygen-free tanks called anaerobic digesters collect methane from hog waste and convert it into natural gas for electricity. Producers argue that this will alleviate the most common issues because covering the lagoons would eliminate the smell and that biogas, considered a renewable resource, would reduce agricultural methane emissions. Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the state, aims to establish biogas pipelines connected to 90% of their farms by 2030. Meanwhile, detractors argue that adopting biogas systems would further cement poor waste management practices in low-income communities and potentially increase water pollution because covering the lagoons could lead to higher concentrations of ammonia in the wastewater. Polluted water seeps into the ground and poisons the groundwater, which feeds into local residents’ wells. Biogas creation also does little to tackle the issue of the toxic “sludge” left over from the process, which remains a pressing concern.

    To tackle this and other environmental justices across the country, the White House introduced a screening tool in 2022, which includes factors such as air pollution, health outcomes, and economic status, to identify communities vulnerable to environmental and economic injustice. While the tool has been heavily criticized for excluding race as a factor, the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality chair Brenda Mallory is optimistic that the tool will help direct federal money for climate, clean energy, and environmental improvements to communities “that have been left out and left behind for far too long.” In the ongoing struggle for  environmental justice, it is imperative that we continue to advocate for comprehensive tools that address the intersecting factors of race, economics, and health to ensure equitable access to environmental resources and opportunities for all communities.
