    ### Introduction
    Pork producers in eastern North Carolina call the stench of pig waste [“the smell of money”](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry) but to the local residents, it’s the scent of environmental inequalities. The proliferation of hog farms in this area has raised significant environmental justice concerns, particularly within low socioeconomic status communities. For example, black North Carolinians are  150% more likely than white residents to live within three miles of a hog farm. Thus, minority populations face disproportionate exposure to the harmful effects of Concentrated Animal Farming Operations (CAFOs).  

    These operations impose an environmental burden encompassing a wide range of issues. Hog farm production waste is typically collected in lagoons or vats, where it is often transferred to nearby fields to be sprayed as fertilizer or converted to biogas. The waste releases methane and ammonia into the atmosphere. When sprayed as a fertilizer, the wind catches the waste and spreads it over the neighboring area, blanketing it in a layer of feces, urine, pus, and blood. The pervasive odor from these lagoons makes basic outdoor activities and chores challenging for communities in these regions. Not only do emissions from waste cause foul odors, they can also be responsible for short-term and long-term health risks. For example, a 2021 [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/05/10/farm-pollution-deaths/) from Duplin County, NC found that about 89 premature deaths per year can be attributed to hog farm emissions. Disasters such as Hurricane Florence in 2018 have exacerbated the environmental impacts of CAFOs by causing the waste lagoons to overflow and leak into the local water supply. 

    In this story, we utilize the gridded methane emissions data compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) developed by the Center for Disease Control to examine how the socially vulnerable population residing in the Wayne, Duplin, Sampson, and Bladen counties of North Carolina are affected by CAFOs. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) hog farm inventory data show that a substantial portion of CAFOs in the state of North Carolina are located in these four counties (Figure 1). Time series of hog farm inventory show (Figure 2) a sharp increase during the 1990s driven by technological advancements including waste management and economic incentives that boosted efficiency and profitability. However, the industry’s growth stabilized in early 2000 because of the adoption of a moratorium on new hog farms in 1997 and stricter regulations by the state of North Carolina prompted by mounting environmental and community concerns.

    ### Methane vs SVI

    A spatial map produced using EPA’s the 2020 U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions Inventory Agriculture - Manure Management dataset shows the presence of a local maximum over the four counties of Wayne, Duplin, Sampson, and Bladen (Figure 3). The spatial map of CDC SVI shows that the local maximum of methane emissions also coincides with high social vulnerability. Note that social vulnerability describes socioeconomic and demographic factors that affect the resilience or incapability of communities to adapt to external stresses (Flanagan et al., 2011; Mah et al., 2023 ). One of the ways to quantify social vulnerability is through the use of a social vulnerability index (SVI), which is an aggregation of socioeconomic and demographic factors. The Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) SVI dataset is one such quantification available for the US and is derived from socioeconomic status, household composition, disability, minority status, housing, and transportation attributes of the U.S. Census Bureau’s census tract data (Flanagan et al., 2011).

    With the SVI dataset produced at the census-tract level the methane emissions from manure management are averaged and binned by SVI. SVI bins correspond to low, medium, high, and very high vulnerabilities defined as; 0 - 0.25, 0.25 - 0.50, 0.50 - 0.75, and 0.75-1 respectively (Figure 4). This analysis shows that populations that reside in census tracts with high and very high social vulnerability census tracts within the four counties of Wayne, Duplin, Sampson, and Bladen are subject to environments with manure-based methane emissions 4 to 5 times higher compared to those in low and medium social vulnerability census tracts. Note that the higher methane emissions from manure management also indicate other CAFO emissions (e.g. ammonia) are higher in these counties.

    The resulting air and water quality degradation can have both short and long-term health effects. Short-term health effects include nausea and vomiting, asthma, and headaches while serious long-term health risks include cancer, increased infant mortality, anemia, kidney disease, tuberculosis and septicemia. 

    To tackle this and other environmental justices across the country, the White House introduced the [White House Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5) in 2022, which includes factors such as air pollution, health outcomes, and economic status to identify communities vulnerable to environmental and economic injustice. While the tool currently excludes race as a factor, data from the White House's Council on Environmental Quality has the potential to enhance decision making related to environmental justice by directing federal aid for climate, clean energy, and environmental improvements to underserved communities.

    For example, data from the screening tool provides additional valuable information on the disproportionate impacts of hog farms for Bladen, Duplin, Sampson, and Wayne counties when compared to the rest of North Carolina (Table 1). More than 70% of the population in these counties are classified as disadvantaged, impacting nearly 200,000 people in counties where hog farming is prevalent. The population in these counties is nearly evenly distributed between white and non-white races. Compared to the entire state of North Carolina, 38% of the population is non-white and only 37% is classified as disadvantaged. Hog farms within Bladen, Duplin, Sampson, and Wayne counties significantly increase the percentage of the population classified as disadvantaged when compared to the overall population in North Carolina.

    For environmental justice related decision making, development of comprehensive tools that address social vulnerability (intersecting factors including age, race, access to transportation, domicile and economics) and health are critical to ensure equitable access of resources and opportunities.
