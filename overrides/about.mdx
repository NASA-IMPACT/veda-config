  The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) is a multi-agency effort consolidating greenhouse gas (GHG) information from observations and models. Scientific experts from NASA, EPA, NIST, and NOAA worked together to curate this catalog of GHG datasets and analysis tools. The goal is to better understand GHG fluxes and emissions from natural and human-caused sources. The US GHG Center helps researchers, climate change mitigation practitioners, policymakers, data service providers, and concerned citizens understand GHG datasets and put them to use.
  
  The initial two-year demonstration phase focused on three GHG areas of study: human-caused GHG emissions; natural GHG sources and sinks, fluxes, and patterns; and large methane emission leak events.

  The US GHG Center portal is built using open source principles and techniques allowing users to access, explore, analyze, and download data and products and learn about the latest information. It provides access to a curated and evolving list of foundational GHG data, including sources such as: ground observations from NASA, NIST, and NOAA; data collected from space-borne (ex. EMIT and OCO-2/3), airborne (ex. AVIRIS-NG), and ground-based platforms (ex. NIST tower data); and model-derived data and analyses. The US GHG Center includes curated EPA regulatory and research datasets as well as research data from NASA, NIST, and NOAA.

  The portal features stories that introduce themes, topics, data and discoveries. User support is within reach via data exploration, Jupyter notebooks, and an analysis hub for authorized users to perform advanced cloud data analysis with computational resources. All code supporting the US GHG Center system is fully open sourced and available for examination.

## Our Partners

The US GHG Center would not be possible without the collaboration of the partnering U.S. governmental agencies and other non-governmental entities. The initial partners of this effort are NASA, EPA, NIST, and NOAA.

 NASA plays a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the universe and advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.  As the lead agency for implementing the US GHG Center, the effort is shared among various NASA centers and coordinated by the project office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Technical development and implementation of the US GHG Center portal is carried out by a team at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory produce many of the NASA datasets available from the portal (for example EMIT and various model datasets). NASA’s leadership of the US GHG Center accelerates collaborative use of Earth science data and information for GHG monitoring, measurement, reporting, and decision support.

 The EPA is a vital agency committed to protecting human health and the environment. The inclusion of EPA in the US GHG Center effort ensures portal users have access to valuable and relevant EPA resources, research, and regulatory information related to environmental issues, sustainability, and public health. By incorporating EPA's insights and guidelines into Center content, we aim to raise awareness and encourage responsible practices that contribute to a healthier planet.

 As an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA data helps to empower users with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their lives and the environment. NOAA focuses on public understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and safeguarding its resources. As a member of the US GHG Center, NOAA provides accurate and up-to-date information on greenhouse gas monitoring and the research to increase understanding of greenhouse gas impacts on Earth’s environment.

## Joining Forces for a Better Future

  Through partnerships with other organizations, the US GHG Center portal provides a comprehensive platform that fosters learning, discovery, and positive change. Together, it strives to inspire curiosity, promote scientific literacy, and drive progress in various fields. The Center looks forward to expanding into a network of partners and continuing to build a community that values knowledge and innovation.
