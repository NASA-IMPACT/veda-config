      The VEDA Dashboard is one of several user interfaces in the VEDA project. It also is aligned with VEDA's goal of advancing interactive visualization and exploratory visual data analysis. This dashboard constitutes:

    - an evolution of COVID-19 dashboard to provide the interactive storytelling for various environmental changes using Earth observation data;
    - a transformation of high-valued NASA datasets to dynamic visualization, enabling users to perform on-the-fly visual analysis;
    - support for environmental justice initiatives through the integration of NASA Earth observation data and socio-economic data;
    - a tool by which users can visually explore and localize data, and perform independent analysis; data-driven stories that are exportable in multiple formats;
    - and a situational awareness system that brings together Earth observation datasets such as greenhouse gasses, air quality, and sea level rise, among others.

    As an interactive visual interface for storytelling, the dashboard provides a number of capabilities including sharing and interacting with datasets and their respective stories. Through visualizations, trend analyses, and comparative analyses of datasets, users can explore the applications and implications of those data. The VEDA Dashboard aims to reduce the barrier to entry of NASA of the Earth science data and enable faster science â€“ one of the goals of the NASA open-source science initiative. Please submit any feedback or questions using the Feedback button in the top right of the dashboard.

    ## Commitment to Open Science

    In alignment with NASA's [Transform to Open Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) (TOPS) initiative, VEDA believes that a commitment to open source is an important aspect of creating and maintaining high-quality software and science. Open source code provided by VEDA as part of this initiative allows for collaboration and transparency, to promote better solutions and more robust code.

    The different repositories of the VEDA project are all open and can be freely browsed:
    - [veda-ui](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui) (the web application)
    - [veda-config](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-config) (content storage)
    - [veda-data-pipelines](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-data-pipelines) (data transformation and ingest)
    - [veda-backend](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-backend) (backend stac and tiler)
    
    The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-IMPACT/repositories?language=&q=veda-&sort=&type=all).
    
    Furthermore this project would not be possible without many other openly maintained projects like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [MapboxGl](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel), [STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec), and [TiTiler](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler) to name a few.
