  The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) is a multi-agency effort consolidating greenhouse gas (GHG) information from observations and models. Scientific experts from NASA, EPA, NIST, and NOAA worked together to curate this catalog of GHG datasets and analysis tools. The goal is to better understand GHG fluxes and emissions from natural and human-caused sources. The US GHG Center helps researchers, climate change mitigation practitioners, policymakers, data service providers, and concerned citizens understand GHG datasets and put them to use.
  
  The initial two-year demonstration phase targets three GHG areas of study:
  1.	Human-caused GHG emissions
  2.	Natural GHG sources and sinks, fluxes, and patterns
  3.  Methane emission leaks from large events
  
  The US GHG Center is built on open source principles and techniques. It allows users to access, explore, analyze, and download data and products. The US GHG Center provides access to a curated and evolving list of foundational GHG data. This includes sources such as ground observations from NASA, NIST, and NOAA; data collected from space-borne (ex. EMIT and OCO-2/3) and airborne (ex. AVIRIS-NG) platforms, and model-derived data and analyses. The US GHG Center includes curated EPA regulatory and research datasets as well as research data from NASA, NIST, and NOAA. It features data insights to introduce topics and data, user support for open data exploration via Jupyter notebooks, and an analysis hub for authorized users to perform advanced cloud data analysis with computational resources. All code supporting the US GHG Center system is fully open sourced and available for examination.

  Numerous stakeholder engagement activities will help scope and prioritize the evolution of US GHG Center during its 2-year demonstration phase and its longer term implementation.

**[NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.noaa.gov/)**  
 NOAA focuses on public understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and safeguarding its resources. NOAA provides accurate and up-to-date information on greenhouse gas monitoring and the research to increase understanding of greenhouse gas impacts on Earth's environment. As an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA data helps to empower users with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their lives and the environment.

## Joining Forces for a Better Future

  Through partnerships with other organizations, the US GHG Center provides a comprehensive platform that fosters learning, discovery, and positive change. Together, it strives to inspire curiosity, promote scientific literacy, and drive progress in various fields. The Center looks forward to expanding into a network of partners and continuing to build a community that values knowledge and innovation.
