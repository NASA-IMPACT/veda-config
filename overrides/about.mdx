  The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center is a multi-agency effort in which science experts from NASA, EPA, NIST, and NOAA work together to study, develop and consolidate greenhouse gas (GHG) knowledge, information and data from observations and models. The goal is to gather and synthesize the latest data and information about GHG fluxes and emissions from both natural and human-caused sources. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center team works collaboratively to enhance available data, improve usability and coordinate needed research activities.  
  
  One result of this multi-agency effort is development and operation of the public-facing, curated web portal consisting of GHG stories, datasets and analysis tools. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center web portal helps researchers, climate change mitigation practitioners, policymakers, federal, state and local government decision makers, data service providers, and concerned citizens better understand GHGs and put trusted data to use.
  
  The initial two-year demonstration phase focused on three GHG areas of study: human-caused GHG emissions; natural GHG sources and sinks, fluxes, and patterns; and large methane emission leak events.  
  
  More recently, the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center focus has turned to urban area GHGs and to providing state and municipal regions with actionable data and information needed to improve decision-making and policy development. 

  The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center web portal is built using open source principles and techniques allowing users to access, explore, analyze, and download data and products and learn about the latest information. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center provides access to a curated and evolving list of foundational GHG data. This includes sources such as ground observations from NASA, NIST, and NOAA; data collected from space-borne (ex. EMIT and OCO-2/3), airborne (ex. AVIRIS-NG), and ground-based platforms (ex. NIST tower data), and model-derived data and analyses. The portal features stories that introduce themes, topics, data and discoveries.  User support for data exploration, Jupyter notebooks, and an analysis hub for authorized users to perform advanced cloud data analysis with computational resources are all within reach. All code supporting the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center portal system is fully open sourced and available for examination.  
  
  Begin your journey by exploring the “[Introduction to the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center.](https://ghg-demo.netlify.app/stories/intro-us-ghg-center)”. Additional demonstration videos show users how to explore and discover data.
  
  Numerous stakeholder engagement activities continue to help scope and prioritize the evolution of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center during continued development and implementation.

## Our Partners

The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center would not be possible without the collaboration of the partnering U.S. governmental agencies and other non-governmental entities. The initial partners of this effort are the NASA, EPA, NIST, and NOAA.

**[NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)](https://www.nasa.gov/)**  
 NASA plays a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the universe and advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.  As the lead agency for implementing the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, the effort is shared among various NASA centers and coordinated by the project office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Technical development and implementation of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center portal is carried out by a team at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory produce many of the NASA datasets available from the portal (for example EMIT and various model datasets). NASA’s leadership of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center accelerates collaborative use of Earth science data and information for GHG monitoring, measurement, reporting, and decision support.

**[EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)](https://www.epa.gov/)**  
 The EPA is a vital agency committed to protecting human health and the environment. The inclusion of EPA in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center effort ensures portal users have access to valuable and relevant EPA resources, research, and regulatory information related to environmental issues, sustainability, and public health. By incorporating EPA's insights and guidelines into Center content, we aim to raise awareness and encourage responsible practices that contribute to a healthier planet.

**[NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.noaa.gov/)**  
 As an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA data helps to empower users with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their lives and the environment. NOAA focuses on public understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and safeguarding its resources. As a member of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, NOAA provides accurate and up-to-date information on greenhouse gas monitoring and the research to increase understanding of greenhouse gas impacts on Earth’s environment.

## Joining Forces for a Better Future

  Through partnerships with other organizations, the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center portal provides a comprehensive platform that fosters learning, discovery, and positive change. Together, it strives to inspire curiosity, promote scientific literacy, and drive progress in various fields. The Center looks forward to expanding into a network of partners and continuing to build a community that values knowledge and innovation.
