  The U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center is a multi-agency effort to extend accessible and integrated GHG data and modeling capabilities from the U.S government and non-public sources for scalable impact.  The GHG Center provides open access to some of the latest GHG data from a variety of sources including in situ observations, data collected from satellite and airborne platforms, and model-derived data. This includes government regulatory data as well as data from climate researchers and modeling efforts. With the vast wealth of data pertaining to greenhouse gasses, greenhouse gas emissions, and related climate processes and variables, it is important to understand the differences between these data and how it can be used. The GHG Center strives to provide a hub with resources to educate the public on GHG datasets produced across the U.S. government and from private industry partners.  
  
  The GHG Center is committed to providing open access to all data featured on this website. The code supporting the GHG Center system is fully open sourced.  Environments are available to authorized users for performing data analysis with computational resources.
